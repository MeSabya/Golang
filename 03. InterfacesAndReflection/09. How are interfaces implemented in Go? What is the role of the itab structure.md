## How are interfaces implemented in Go? What is the role of the itab structure?
For every single type created in Golang and for functions, a type description structure is created. 
These are InterfaceType for interfaces, StructType for structs, and so on. 

Now, letâ€™s consider an example of how interfaces and structs are typically used.

```go
type Vehicle interface {
  Accelerate()
  Brake()
}

type Car struct {
  name  string
  color string
  age   int
}

func (c Car) Accelerate() {}
func (c Car) Brake() {}
func (c Car) Airbag() {}

func main() {
  var v Vehicle
  c := Car{"Mazda", "Red", 5}
  v = c
}
```

### Role of the itab Structure
The itab (interface table) is a runtime structure used to connect an interface to its concrete implementation. It acts as a bridge between the interface type and the concrete type.

#### Components of itab:

- Interface type descriptor: Information about the interface type.
- Concrete type descriptor: Information about the concrete type implementing the interface.
- Method table: Function pointers for the concrete type's implementations of the interface methods.

#### How itab Works: 
When a value of a concrete type is assigned to an interface, the runtime creates an itab that links the interface methods to the corresponding 
methods of the concrete type. This mapping ensures that method calls on the interface are dynamically dispatched to the correct implementation.

## Runtime Overhead of Empty Interfaces (interface{}) vs. Typed Interfaces?

### Empty Interfaces (interface{})
An empty interface can hold a value of any type. For example:

```go
var i interface{}
i = 42       // int
i = "hello"  // string
i = 3.14     // float64
```

#### Why Empty Interfaces Have Runtime Overhead
Since an empty interface doesn't specify any methods or type restrictions:

- The Go runtime must store and track the exact type and value of whatever is assigned to the interface.
- This requires maintaining runtime type information (RTTI) for every value stored in the interface.
- Operations like type assertions or type switches require extra runtime checks to determine whether the stored type matches the expected type.

Example:

```go
var i interface{} = 42
if v, ok := i.(string); ok { // The runtime has to verify the type
    fmt.Println(v)
} else {
    fmt.Println("Type mismatch") // Prints this, since `i` holds an int
}
```
This dynamic behavior introduces extra runtime work, including:

- Inspecting the stored type.
- Validating type assertions or performing type switches.


### Typed Interfaces
Typed interfaces specify a set of methods that a type must implement. For example:

```go
type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}

type MyType struct {}

func (m MyType) String() string {
    return "MyType instance"
}
```
When you assign a value to a typed interface, the runtime knows at compile-time which methods the interface requires. This results in:

A static contract between the interface and its concrete implementation.
Efficient method resolution at runtime using the itab structure.

Example:

```go
var s Stringer
s = MyType{}  // At runtime, the `String()` method of `MyType` is linked via the itab
fmt.Println(s.String()) // Efficiently resolved at runtime
```

#### Why Typed Interfaces Have Less Overhead
The set of required methods is fixed at compile-time, so method lookups are more efficient.
There's no need to handle arbitrary types, reducing the amount of type-related metadata stored and checked at runtime.

## Go Scheduler: A Deeper Dive
The Go scheduler is a user-space implementation of M:N scheduling, meaning:

- M goroutines (user threads)
- Scheduled onto N OS threads
- Managed by P (processors) as logical execution contexts

Core Design: G-M-P Model

### üßµ G (Goroutine)
- Represents a lightweight thread of execution.
- Has a small stack (starts at 2KB, grows/shrinks dynamically).
- Includes metadata: stack, program counter, scheduler state.

### üß† M (Machine)
- An actual OS thread.
- Executes goroutines.
- Can block on syscalls ‚Äî Go will spin up another M to keep things running.

### ‚öôÔ∏è P (Processor)
- Schedules goroutines to machines.
- Maintains a run queue of goroutines.
- Controls access to Go runtime resources like memory allocation.
- Each M must be attached to a P to execute Go code.

### Execution Flow Summary
- A goroutine (G) is created and added to a P‚Äôs run queue.
- M (OS thread) picks G from the queue and executes.
- If G blocks (on I/O/syscall), the P detaches from that M and picks another M.
- Idle P can steal Gs from other P's run queues to balance load (work stealing).
- GOMAXPROCS defines how many Ps are active (defaults to number of CPUs).

### Scheduler Lifecycle Example
Let‚Äôs say G1, G2, and G3 exist and GOMAXPROCS = 2.

```css
[P1] runs [G1, G2] using [M1]
[P2] runs [G3] using [M2]
```

- If G2 blocks:
- M1 may block too.
- P1 detaches from M1, attaches to M3 (new OS thread), and continues scheduling.

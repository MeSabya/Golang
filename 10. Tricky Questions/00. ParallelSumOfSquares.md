## ParallelSumOfSquares
Write a Go function that takes a slice of integers and returns the sum of the squares of even numbers. The twist is that the function should use goroutines and channels to parallelize the computation.

### Solution

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func squareWorker(nums []int, resultChan chan int, wg *sync.WaitGroup, errChan chan error, mu *sync.Mutex) {
	defer wg.Done()
	sum := 0
	for _, num := range nums {
		sum += num * num
	}

	mu.Lock()
	defer mu.Unlock()

	select {
	case resultChan <- sum:
	default:
		errChan <- fmt.Errorf("failed to send result to channel")
	}
}

func parallelSumOfSquares(nums []int) (int, error) {
	const numWorkers = 4
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	resultChan := make(chan int, numWorkers)
	errChan := make(chan error, numWorkers)
	var mu sync.Mutex

	chunkSize := len(nums) / numWorkers
	for i := 0; i < numWorkers; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		start := i * chunkSize
		end := (i + 1) * chunkSize
		if i == numWorkers-1 {
			end = len(nums)
		}
		go squareWorker(nums[start:end], resultChan, &wg, errChan, &mu)
	}

	go func() {
		wg.Wait()
		mu.Lock()
		close(resultChan)
    close(errChan)
		mu.Unlock()
	}()

	totalSum := 0
	for {
		select {
		case sum, ok := <-resultChan:
			if !ok {
				// Channel closed, all values received
				return totalSum, nil
			}
			totalSum += sum
		case err := <-errChan:
			return 0, err
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	input := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
	result, err := parallelSumOfSquares(input)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println(result)
}
```

### Explanation
Here are a couple of aspects to consider:

#### Error Handling:
if a worker goroutine encounters an unexpected error, it should be reported or handled. Proper error handling, such as using a separate channel to communicate errors
or a more sophisticated error-handling strategy, would be a good addition.

#### Race Condition:

Writing to the resultChan concurrently from multiple goroutines can lead to a race condition. 
While the code attempts to close the channel after all workers have finished using the sync.WaitGroup, 
it should ensure that all writes to the channel have completed before closing it otherwise this could result in data being lost or panics due to writing to a closed channel. 

#### Using select statements 
The select statement is indeed used to handle the case where writing to a closed channel might occur. 
In the provided code, the default case in the select statement is used to handle the scenario when the resultChan is closed.

#### Passing the WaitGroup and Mutex as reference 
sync.WaitGroup is a struct that contains fields, including a counter, and methods to manipulate that counter. When you pass it to a function without using a pointer, 
you're working with a copy of the WaitGroup, and any changes made to the counter within the function won't affect the original WaitGroup outside the function.
To allow the function to decrement the counter and affect the original WaitGroup, a pointer to the WaitGroup is passed. This way, the function works directly with the original WaitGroup rather than a copy.

In Go, channels are reference types, and they are passed by reference. When you pass a channel to a function, you are effectively passing a reference to the same underlying channel. 
There's no need to use a pointer to the channel.

#### Waiting for the goroutines inside a lambda 
The purpose of this construction is to ensure that the main goroutine or other parts of the program that rely on the completion of worker goroutines will wait until all the work is done before proceeding. 
The use of the anonymous function and goroutine allows this waiting and channel closing logic to happen concurrently with the rest of the program.

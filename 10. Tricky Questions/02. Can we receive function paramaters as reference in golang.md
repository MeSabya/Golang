## Can we receive function paramaters as reference in golang 

In Go, all function parameters are passed by value, which means that the function receives a copy of the argument's value. However, when working with certain types, such as slices, maps, channels, and pointers, the behavior can resemble passing by reference.

Let's look at some examples:

### Example 1: Slices
```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func modifySlice(s []int) {
    s[0] = 99
}

func main() {
    originalSlice := []int{1, 2, 3}
    modifySlice(originalSlice)
    fmt.Println(originalSlice) // Output: [99 2 3]
}
```

### Example 2: Maps
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func modifyMap(m map[string]int) {
    m["newKey"] = 99
}

func main() {
    originalMap := map[string]int{"key": 42}
    modifyMap(originalMap)
    fmt.Println(originalMap) // Output: map[key:42 newKey:99]
}
```

### Example 3: Passing slice to reverse 

```go
func reverse(nodes []int) {
    n := len(nodes)
    first , last := 0, n-1

    for first < last {
        nodes[first], nodes[last] = nodes[last], nodes[first]
        first++
        last--
    }
}
```
Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

- When you call reverse(nodes), you're passing a reference to the nodes slice.
- Inside the reverse function, you modify the elements of the nodes slice by swapping them.
- Since nodes is a reference to the original slice, these modifications are reflected in the original slice outside of the function.

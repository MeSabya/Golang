## When to Use reflect.DeepEqual

- Complex Nested Structures:

When you need to compare complex nested structures such as slices, maps, and structs, where simple equality operators (like ==) are insufficient.
- Testing:

In unit tests, to compare expected and actual values, especially when dealing with composite types like slices of structs or maps.
- Generic Functions:

When writing generic functions that operate on different types, and you need a way to compare values for equality.

### Find the output of the below code

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "reflect"
)

func main() {
    var slice1 []int
    slice2 := []int{}
    fmt.Println(reflect.DeepEqual(slice1, slice2)) // Output: false

    var map1 map[string]int
    map2 := map[string]int{}
    fmt.Println(reflect.DeepEqual(map1, map2)) // Output: false
}
```

In the provided code, you are using reflect.DeepEqual to compare two slices and two maps. 
The results show that a nil slice or map is not considered equal to an empty slice or map. Let's break down why this happens.

- slice1 is declared as a slice of integers, but it is not initialized. In Go, uninitialized slices have a nil value.
- slice2 is initialized as an empty slice of integers. Although it contains no elements, it is not nil; it has a non-nil underlying array with zero length.

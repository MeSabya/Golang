## What is a common pattern to signal goroutines to stop using channels?

A common pattern to signal goroutines to stop using channels is the "done channel" pattern. This involves creating a channel specifically for signaling goroutines to exit or stop processing. Here’s how it typically works:

### Done Channel Pattern
Create a Done Channel:

A channel of type chan struct{} is often used as a signal, since it’s a zero-byte type and doesn't carry any data—just the fact that it’s been closed or has a value sent on it is enough to signal a stop.
Listen for the Signal in the Goroutine:

The goroutine selects between its main work and a signal from the done channel.
Close the Done Channel:

To signal the goroutine(s) to stop, you close the done channel, which causes all listeners to receive the stop signal.
```golang
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func worker(id int, done <-chan struct{}) {
    for {
        select {
        case <-done:
            fmt.Printf("Worker %d stopping\n", id)
            return
        default:
            fmt.Printf("Worker %d is working...\n", id)
            time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond) // Simulating work
        }
    }
}

func main() {
    done := make(chan struct{})

    // Start multiple workers
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        go worker(i, done)
    }

    // Let them work for some time
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

    // Signal all workers to stop
    close(done)

    // Give some time to observe the workers stopping
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("All workers stopped.")
}
```
### Using a context.Context

The context package provides a robust way to manage cancellations and timeouts. 
This is often preferred in more complex applications or when dealing with APIs that support contexts.

How It Works:

You create a context.Context with a context.WithCancel, context.WithTimeout, or context.WithDeadline function.
The goroutine listens for the cancellation signal through the context.
When the context is cancelled (or the timeout/deadline is reached), the goroutine can clean up and exit.

```golang
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func worker(ctx context.Context, id int) {
    for {
        select {
        case <-ctx.Done():
            fmt.Printf("Worker %d stopping\n", id)
            return
        default:
            fmt.Printf("Worker %d is working...\n", id)
            time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond) // Simulating work
        }
    }
}

func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())

    // Start multiple workers
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        go worker(ctx, i)
    }

    // Let them work for some time
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

    // Signal all workers to stop
    cancel()

    // Give some time to observe the workers stopping
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("All workers stopped.")
}
```

### Using a sync.Cond for Notification
sync.Cond can be used to signal one or more goroutines waiting on a condition to stop.

How It Works:
Goroutines wait for a condition to be met.
When the condition changes (e.g., stop signal), all waiting goroutines are notified to proceed.
Example Code:

```golang
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"
)

func worker(cond *sync.Cond, stop *bool, id int) {
    cond.L.Lock()
    for !*stop {
        cond.Wait()
    }
    cond.L.Unlock()
    fmt.Printf("Worker %d stopping\n", id)
}

func main() {
    var mu sync.Mutex
    cond := sync.NewCond(&mu)
    stop := false

    // Start multiple workers
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        go worker(cond, &stop, i)
    }

    // Let them work for some time
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)

    // Signal all workers to stop
    cond.L.Lock()
    stop = true
    cond.Broadcast() // Notify all waiting goroutines
    cond.L.Unlock()

    // Give some time to observe the workers stopping
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("All workers stopped.")
}
```

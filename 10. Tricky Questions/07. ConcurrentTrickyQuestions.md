## Question1
```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	c := make(chan int, 1)
	c <- 1
	go func() {
		c <- 2
	}()
	fmt.Println(<-c)
	time.Sleep(time.Second)
}
```
### Answer
The code will print 1. The channel c is buffered with a size of 1, so the main goroutine can send 1 to the channel without blocking. 
The goroutine that sends 2 will block until the main goroutine reads the value 1 from the channel. 
Since 1 is read first, 2 is sent to the channel and will be available after the time.Sleep.

## Question2 

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func worker(c chan int) {
	for {
		select {
		case n := <-c:
			fmt.Println("Received:", n)
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	c := make(chan int)
	go worker(c)

	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
	close(c)
}
```
### Answer 
The issue is that the goroutine created by worker will enter an infinite loop after the channel c is closed, leading to a goroutine leak. This happens because the select statement in the worker function does not handle the case when the channel is closed.

### Solution

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func worker(c chan int) {
	for {
		select {
		case n, ok := <-c:
			if !ok {
				fmt.Println("Channel closed")
				return
			}
			fmt.Println("Received:", n)
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	c := make(chan int)
	go worker(c)

	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
	close(c)
}
```

## What will happen when the code is compiled, what will the line fmt.Println(*value) output, and how can we fix all errors?

```golang
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "sync"
)

func main() {
  ch := make(chan *int, 4)
  array := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
  wg := sync.WaitGroup{}
  wg.Add(1)
  go func() {
    for _, value := range array {
      ch <- &value
    }
  }()
  go func() {
    for value := range ch {
      fmt.Println(*value) // what will be printed here?
    }
    wg.Done()
  }()

  wg.Wait()
}
```
### answer is: we will have a deadlock!
The deadlock occurs because the sender goroutine (go func()) is not closed, and the receiving goroutine (go func()) is waiting indefinitely for more values from the channel.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

- The sender goroutine starts sending pointers to the channel (ch <- &value) in a loop.
- The receiver goroutine starts reading values from the channel (for value := range ch).
- The sender goroutine completes the loop and exits without closing the channel.
- The receiver goroutine continues waiting for more values from the channel.
- Since the channel is not closed, the receiver goroutine keeps waiting, and the main goroutine (wg.Wait()) is waiting for all goroutines to finish.

The deadlock occurs because neither the sender nor the receiver can proceed, resulting in the program being stuck. close the channel to solve deadlock.

### Now that our code is working, what will be outputted by fmt.Println(*value)?
It will output 4, 4, 4, 4.

When you range over the array and send pointers to its elements into the channel, you are capturing the address of the loop variable. 
This can lead to unexpected behavior because the value of the loop variable changes in each iteration.

To fix this issue, you should create a copy of the loop variable inside the loop:

```golang
go func() {
    for _, value := range array {
        val := value  // create a copy of the loop variable
        ch <- &val
    }
}()
```

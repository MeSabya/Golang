Design Snake Game – You need to implement a snake game on a grid of size height x width. The snake starts at the top-left cell (0,0) with an initial length of 1. You are given a list of food positions on the grid, in the order they will appear. The snake can move in four directions: up U, down D, left L, or right R. Each move will shift the snake’s head by one cell in the given direction. The game should handle the following rules:

Food Eating: If the snake’s head moves onto a food cell, the snake eats the food. The snake’s length increases by 1 and the score increases by 1 . After eating, the next food in the list will appear on the grid (foods appear one at a time in sequence). It’s guaranteed that a new piece of food never appears at a cell currently occupied by the snake.

Movement Without Food: If the snake moves without eating food, it simply moves forward: its head occupies a new cell and its tail leaves the last cell (so length stays the same).

Game Over Conditions: The game ends (move should return -1) if the snake's head moves out of the grid boundaries or if the head collides with the snake’s own body.

You need to implement a class SnakeGame with a constructor and a move(direction) method:

SnakeGame(int width, int height, int[][] food): Initializes the game grid and food list.
int move(String direction): Moves the snake in the given direction. Returns the game score (number of foods eaten so far) after the move, or -1 if the game is over due to collision or boundary hit.
Example 1: Basic movement and eating
Input:

["SnakeGame", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move"]  
[[3, 2, [[1, 2], [0, 1]]], ["R"], ["D"], ["R"], ["U"], ["L"], ["U"]]  
Output:

[null, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, -1]

## Challenges:
### 1. Efficient Snake Body Management
Challenge: We need to keep track of the snake's current body positions and be able to check for collisions quickly.

###  2. Food Consumption Logic
Challenge: Identifying when the snake eats food and ensuring it grows.

### 3. Collision Detection
Challenge: Ensure the snake doesn't move into its own body or beyond the grid.

### 4. Avoiding Backtracking
Challenge: Prevent the snake from turning into itself.


```golang
package main

import "fmt"

// Position represents a coordinate on the board
type Position struct {
	x, y int
}

// Snake holds the snake body and occupied positions for O(1) collision check
type Snake struct {
	body     []Position         // body[0] is head, last is tail
	occupied map[Position]bool  // positions occupied by snake
}

// Game holds the game state
type Game struct {
	width, height int
	foodQueue     []Position
	snake         *Snake
	score         int
	dirs          map[string]Position
}

// Constructor initializes the game with width, height, and food positions
func Constructor(width int, height int, food [][]int) *Game {
	foodPositions := make([]Position, len(food))
	for i, f := range food {
		foodPositions[i] = Position{f[0], f[1]}
	}

	// Initial snake position is at (0,0)
	initialPos := Position{0, 0}
	snake := &Snake{
		body:     []Position{initialPos},
		occupied: map[Position]bool{initialPos: true},
	}

	return &Game{
		width:     width,
		height:    height,
		foodQueue: foodPositions,
		snake:     snake,
		score:     0,
		dirs: map[string]Position{
			"U": {-1, 0},
			"D": {1, 0},
			"L": {0, -1},
			"R": {0, 1},
		},
	}
}

// Move moves the snake in the given direction
// Returns the game's score after the move, or -1 if game over
func (g *Game) Move(direction string) int {
	dir, ok := g.dirs[direction]
	if !ok {
		return -1 // invalid direction
	}

	head := g.snake.body[0]
	newHead := Position{head.x + dir.x, head.y + dir.y}

	// Check if new head is out of bounds
	if newHead.x < 0 || newHead.x >= g.height || newHead.y < 0 || newHead.y >= g.width {
		return -1
	}

	// Remove tail from occupied set temporarily (because the snake moves forward)
	tail := g.snake.body[len(g.snake.body)-1]
	delete(g.snake.occupied, tail)

	// Check if new head hits the snake body (self collision)
	if g.snake.occupied[newHead] {
		return -1
	}

	// Add new head to the front of the body
	g.snake.body = append([]Position{newHead}, g.snake.body...)
	g.snake.occupied[newHead] = true

	// Check if new head is on food
	if len(g.foodQueue) > 0 && g.foodQueue[0] == newHead {
		// Eat the food: increase score and remove food from queue
		g.score++
		g.foodQueue = g.foodQueue[1:]
		// Tail stays (snake grows), so re-add tail to occupied
		g.snake.occupied[tail] = true
	} else {
		// No food eaten: remove tail from body (snake moves)
		g.snake.body = g.snake.body[:len(g.snake.body)-1]
		// tail was already removed from occupied earlier
	}

	return g.score
}

// Simple driver code to test
func main() {
	game := Constructor(3, 3, [][]int{{2, 0}, {0, 0}, {0, 2}, {2, 2}})

	moves := []string{"D", "D", "R", "U", "U", "L"}
	for _, move := range moves {
		score := game.Move(move)
		fmt.Printf("Move: %s, Score: %d\n", move, score)
		if score == -1 {
			fmt.Println("Game Over!")
			break
		}
	}
}
```

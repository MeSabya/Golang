## Flawed Example Violating Interface Segregation

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

// PaymentMethodAndBillPrinter interface violates ISP by forcing implementations to handle both payment processing and bill printing.
type PaymentMethodAndBillPrinter interface {
    ProcessPayment(amount float64)
    PrintBill(payment Payment)
}

// UpiPayment struct implementing PaymentMethodAndBillPrinter
type UpiPayment struct{}

func (u *UpiPayment) ProcessPayment(amount float64) {
    fmt.Printf("UPI payment of %.2f completed.\n", amount)
}

func (u *UpiPayment) PrintBill(payment Payment) {
    fmt.Printf("Bill: %s\nAmount: %.2f\nDate: %s\nPayment Method: %s\nThank you for using UPI!\n",
        payment.Name, payment.Amount, payment.Date, payment.PaymentMethod)
}

// CreditCardPayment struct implementing PaymentMethodAndBillPrinter
type CreditCardPayment struct{}

func (c *CreditCardPayment) ProcessPayment(amount float64) {
    fmt.Printf("Credit card payment of %.2f completed.\n", amount)
}

func (c *CreditCardPayment) PrintBill(payment Payment) {
    fmt.Printf("Bill: %s\nAmount: %.2f\nDate: %s\nPayment Method: %s\nThank you for using Credit Card!\n",
        payment.Name, payment.Amount, payment.Date, payment.PaymentMethod)
}

// Payment struct holding payment details
type Payment struct {
    Amount        float64
    Name          string
    Date          string
    PaymentMethod string
}

// PaymentProcessor is responsible for processing payments and printing bills
type PaymentProcessor struct {
    Method PaymentMethodAndBillPrinter
}

// MakePayment processes the payment using the provided PaymentMethodAndBillPrinter
func (pp *PaymentProcessor) MakePayment(amount float64) {
    pp.Method.ProcessPayment(amount)
    pp.Method.PrintBill(Payment{Amount: amount, Name: "Customer", PaymentMethod: "UPI", Date: "2024-11-15"})
}

func main() {
    // Using UPI Payment method
    paymentUpi := Payment{Amount: 1200, Name: "Sabya", Date: "2024-11-15", PaymentMethod: "UPI"}
    paymentProcessorUpi := PaymentProcessor{Method: &UpiPayment{}}
    paymentProcessorUpi.MakePayment(paymentUpi.Amount)

    fmt.Println("\n---")

    // Using CreditCard Payment method
    paymentCreditCard := Payment{Amount: 1500, Name: "Ravi", Date: "2024-11-15", PaymentMethod: "CreditCard"}
    paymentProcessorCreditCard := PaymentProcessor{Method: &CreditCardPayment{}}
    paymentProcessorCreditCard.MakePayment(paymentCreditCard.Amount)
}
```

## Issues in This Flawed Example

### Large, Monolithic Interface:

The PaymentMethodAndBillPrinter interface violates the Interface Segregation Principle by combining two completely different responsibilities:
ProcessPayment: Payment processing logic.
PrintBill: Bill printing logic.
This forces any type (e.g., UpiPayment, CreditCardPayment) that implements this interface to handle both responsibilities, even if it doesn't need to.

### Unnecessary Dependencies:

The UpiPayment and CreditCardPayment structs are forced to implement the PrintBill method, even though it’s not their primary responsibility to print bills. In fact, a payment method should only handle payment processing, not how the bill is printed.

### Violating ISP:

Now, if we have a PaymentProcessor that handles payments, but it doesn’t need to print bills (e.g., if we want to process payments separately from bill printing), it is forced to implement the PrintBill method unnecessarily.

The PaymentProcessor class is forced to deal with both processing payments and printing bills in a single interface, thus violating ISP.

### How This Violates ISP:

- The payment processing logic and bill printing logic are tightly coupled in the PaymentMethodAndBillPrinter interface.
- Any implementation of this interface has to deal with both responsibilities, even if one is not relevant to the specific implementation.
- For instance, if we want a PaypalPayment or BankTransferPayment class, it would also have to implement PrintBill, even though the bill printing functionality may be completely unrelated to payment processing.

## Solution
Same refactored example in SRP and OCP.md can be used.

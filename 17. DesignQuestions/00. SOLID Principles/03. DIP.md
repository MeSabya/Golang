Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) Overview:
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). 
Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

ðŸ‘‰ In simpler terms:

- High-level modules should depend on abstractions (interfaces).
- Low-level modules should also depend on abstractions, not on the concrete implementations of high-level modules.

When we violate DIP, high-level modules directly depend on low-level modules, causing tight coupling and making the system harder to maintain and extend.

## Flawed Example Violating Dependency Inversion
In this flawed example, the PaymentProcessor is tightly coupled to concrete payment methods (e.g., UpiPayment and CreditCardPayment), instead of depending on an abstraction (an interface like PaymentMethod).

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

// Payment struct holds details of the payment
type Payment struct {
    Amount        float64
    Name          string
    Date          string
    PaymentMethod string
}

// UpiPayment is a concrete type for UPI payments
type UpiPayment struct{}

func (u *UpiPayment) ProcessPayment(amount float64) {
    fmt.Printf("UPI payment of %.2f completed.\n", amount)
}

// CreditCardPayment is a concrete type for credit card payments
type CreditCardPayment struct{}

func (c *CreditCardPayment) ProcessPayment(amount float64) {
    fmt.Printf("Credit card payment of %.2f completed.\n", amount)
}

// PaymentProcessor is a high-level module that processes payments
type PaymentProcessor struct {
    // Directly dependent on concrete types, violating DIP
    Method *UpiPayment // This is tightly coupled to the UpiPayment concrete type
}

// MakePayment processes the payment using the concrete UpiPayment method
func (pp *PaymentProcessor) MakePayment(amount float64) {
    pp.Method.ProcessPayment(amount)
}

func main() {
    // Using UPI Payment method
    payment := Payment{Amount: 1200, Name: "Sabya", Date: "2024-11-15", PaymentMethod: "UPI"}
    paymentProcessor := PaymentProcessor{Method: &UpiPayment{}} // Tightly coupled to UpiPayment
    paymentProcessor.MakePayment(payment.Amount)

    // This would need to change PaymentProcessor to use CreditCardPayment
    // If we want to use CreditCardPayment, we would need to modify PaymentProcessor:
    // paymentProcessor.Method = &CreditCardPayment{}
}
```
### Issues in This Flawed Example:
High-Level Module (PaymentProcessor) Depends on Concrete Low-Level Modules (UpiPayment):

- The PaymentProcessor is tightly coupled to the UpiPayment concrete type. This means that PaymentProcessor can only process payments via UPI, and if we want to support other payment methods (e.g., credit card), we need to modify the PaymentProcessor class directly.
- The PaymentProcessor should not depend on the specific details of the payment methods; it should depend on an abstraction (like an interface), which would allow it to work with different types of payments without modification.

## Solution 

Same refactored example 

### Refactored Explanation:
- High-Level Module Depends on Abstraction (PaymentMethod interface):
PaymentProcessor no longer directly depends on the concrete payment methods (UpiPayment or CreditCardPayment). Instead, it depends on the PaymentMethod interface, which defines the contract for processing payments.

- Low-Level Modules (Payment Methods) Implement the Interface:
Both UpiPayment and CreditCardPayment implement the PaymentMethod interface, meaning they provide their own implementations of the ProcessPayment method.

- Flexibility and Extensibility:
To add new payment methods (e.g., PayPalPayment), we just need to create a new type that implements the PaymentMethod interface, and we donâ€™t need to modify the PaymentProcessor class. This follows the open/closed principle and makes the system more flexible.

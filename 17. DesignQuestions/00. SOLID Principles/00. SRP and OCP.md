Suppose you are in super market, bought all the groceries, payment time. Shopkeeper asks for payment mode {UPI, creditcard, food coupons etc}. Then print the bill and submits to you.
How would you implement this , a simple payment system.

## Example1:

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

type Payment struct {
	Amount        float64
	Name          string
	Date          string
	PaymentMethod string
}

func (p *Payment) makePayment() {
	switch p.PaymentMethod {
	case "UPI":
		p.upiPayment()
	case "CreditCard":
		p.creditCardPayment()
	default:
		fmt.Println("Unsupported payment method")
	}
}

func (p *Payment) printBill(payment Payment) {
	fmt.Println("Here is your bill Sir , Thank you")
}

func main() {
	payment := Payment{Amount: 1200, Name: "Sabya", PaymentMethod: "UPI"}
  payment.makePayment()
  payment.printBill(payment)
}
```

## Enhancement
If we wanted to add the enhanced bill printing functionality, then ?

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

// Payment struct handling multiple responsibilities (Payment processing and Bill printing).
type Payment struct {
    Amount        float64
    Name          string
    Date          string
    PaymentMethod string
}

func (p *Payment) makePayment() {
    switch p.PaymentMethod {
    case "UPI":
        p.upiPayment()
    case "CreditCard":
        p.creditCardPayment()
    default:
        fmt.Println("Unsupported payment method")
    }
}

func (p *Payment) upiPayment() {
    fmt.Println("UPI payment done")
}

func (p *Payment) creditCardPayment() {
    fmt.Println("Credit card payment done")
}

// printSimpleBill prints a basic bill with minimal details.
func (p *Payment) printSimpleBill() {
    fmt.Printf("Simple Bill\nCustomer: %s\nAmount: %.2f\nDate: %s\nThank you!\n", 
               p.Name, p.Amount, p.Date)
}

// printDetailedBill prints a more detailed bill with all payment details.
func (p *Payment) printDetailedBill() {
    fmt.Printf("Detailed Bill\nCustomer: %s\nAmount: %.2f\nDate: %s\nPayment Method: %s\nThank you!\n", 
               p.Name, p.Amount, p.Date, p.PaymentMethod)
}

func main() {
    payment := Payment{Amount: 1200, Name: "Sabya", Date: "2024-11-15", PaymentMethod: "UPI"}

    // Process the payment.
    payment.makePayment()

    // Print bills in different formats.
    fmt.Println("\n--- Printing Simple Bill ---")
    payment.printSimpleBill()

    fmt.Println("\n--- Printing Detailed Bill ---")
    payment.printDetailedBill()
}
```

## Do you see a problem
According to SRP, a class or struct should have only one reason to change. Here, Payment class could change either because:

- The format or content of the printed bill changes, requiring modifications in printBill.
ðŸ‘‰ ***- A new payment method is added, requiring changes in makePayment. (OCP, Open-close principle violation)***

Tight Coupling: Payment processing and bill printing are coupled in the Payment struct. Any change in one responsibility could affect the other, making the code harder to maintain and extend.

## Solution

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

// Payment holds basic payment details.
type Payment struct {
    Amount float64
    Name   string
    Date   string
    Method string
}

// PaymentMethod is an interface for processing payments.
type PaymentMethod interface {
    ProcessPayment(amount float64)
}

// UpiPayment handles UPI payment processing.
type UpiPayment struct{}

func (u *UpiPayment) ProcessPayment(amount float64) {
    fmt.Printf("UPI payment of %.2f completed.\n", amount)
}

// CreditCardPayment handles credit card payment processing.
type CreditCardPayment struct{}

func (c *CreditCardPayment) ProcessPayment(amount float64) {
    fmt.Printf("Credit card payment of %.2f completed.\n", amount)
}

// BillPrinter is responsible for printing the bill in different formats.
type BillPrinter struct {
    // Fields can be added here to support customization, such as currency or additional notes.
}

// PrintSimpleBill prints a basic bill with minimal details.
func (bp *BillPrinter) PrintSimpleBill(payment Payment) {
    fmt.Printf("Simple Bill\nCustomer: %s\nAmount: %.2f\nDate: %s\nThank you!\n", 
               payment.Name, payment.Amount, payment.Date)
}

// PrintDetailedBill prints a more detailed bill with all payment details.
func (bp *BillPrinter) PrintDetailedBill(payment Payment) {
    fmt.Printf("Detailed Bill\nCustomer: %s\nAmount: %.2f\nDate: %s\nPayment Method: %s\nThank you!\n", 
               payment.Name, payment.Amount, payment.Date, payment.Method)
}

// PaymentProcessor processes the payment based on the provided payment method.
type PaymentProcessor struct {
    Method PaymentMethod
}

func (pp *PaymentProcessor) MakePayment(amount float64) {
    pp.Method.ProcessPayment(amount)
}

func main() {
    payment := Payment{Amount: 1200, Name: "Sabya", Date: "2024-11-15", Method: "UPI"}

    // Choose the payment method based on user's input.
    var paymentMethod PaymentMethod
    switch payment.Method {
    case "UPI":
        paymentMethod = &UpiPayment{}
    case "CreditCard":
        paymentMethod = &CreditCardPayment{}
    default:
        fmt.Println("Unsupported payment method")
        return
    }

    // Process the payment.
    processor := PaymentProcessor{Method: paymentMethod}
    processor.MakePayment(payment.Amount)

    // Print the bill using different formats.
    billPrinter := BillPrinter{}
    fmt.Println("\n--- Printing Simple Bill ---")
    billPrinter.PrintSimpleBill(payment)

    fmt.Println("\n--- Printing Detailed Bill ---")
    billPrinter.PrintDetailedBill(payment)
}
```

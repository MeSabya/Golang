The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
To demonstrate LSP in the refactored example in SRP and OCP section:
we can use polymorphism where different types of payment processing classes (e.g., UpiPayment and CreditCardPayment) implement a common interface for payment processing.

## Liskov Substitution Principle in Action

- **Substitution**: In the main function, we demonstrate the Liskov Substitution Principle by substituting different payment types (UpiPayment and CreditCardPayment) into the PaymentProcessor. 
The PaymentProcessor doesn't need to know what type of PaymentMethod is being used—it just relies on the fact that the method ProcessPayment will be implemented.

- **Polymorphism**: You can replace UpiPayment with CreditCardPayment (or any future subclass implementing PaymentMethod) without modifying the PaymentProcessor or BillPrinter logic.
  This allows flexibility and extensibility without breaking existing code, demonstrating adherence to LSP.


## Benefits of Using LSP:
### Extensibility: 
You can easily add new payment methods (e.g., PayPalPayment, BitcoinPayment, etc.) by simply creating new structs that implement the PaymentMethod interface. 
No need to modify the PaymentProcessor class or BillPrinter class.

### Maintainability: 
Each class (UpiPayment, CreditCardPayment, etc.) is self-contained and adheres to a clear contract. Changes to one payment method won’t affect others.

### Testability: 
Each payment method can be independently tested by substituting a mock implementation of the PaymentMethod interface, ensuring that the core logic in PaymentProcessor and BillPrinter remains unaffected.

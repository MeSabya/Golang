The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
To demonstrate LSP in the refactored example in SRP and OCP section:
we can use polymorphism where different types of payment processing classes (e.g., UpiPayment and CreditCardPayment) implement a common interface for payment processing.

## Flawed Example Violating LSP
In this flawed example, we will create an inheritance hierarchy where a subclass is not a true substitute for its parent class and leads to incorrect behavior when used in place of the parent class.

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

// PaymentMethod interface defines the contract for payment methods.
type PaymentMethod interface {
    ProcessPayment(amount float64)
}

// UpiPayment implements PaymentMethod
type UpiPayment struct{}

func (u *UpiPayment) ProcessPayment(amount float64) {
    fmt.Printf("UPI payment of %.2f completed.\n", amount)
}

// CreditCardPayment implements PaymentMethod
type CreditCardPayment struct{}

func (c *CreditCardPayment) ProcessPayment(amount float64) {
    fmt.Printf("Credit card payment of %.2f completed.\n", amount)
}

// RefundPayment is a subclass of PaymentMethod but behaves incorrectly.
type RefundPayment struct{}

func (r *RefundPayment) ProcessPayment(amount float64) {
    fmt.Println("Refund initiated. No payment processed.")
}

// Payment struct to hold payment details
type Payment struct {
    Amount        float64
    Name          string
    Date          string
    PaymentMethod string
}

// PaymentProcessor processes the payment using any type that implements PaymentMethod
type PaymentProcessor struct {
    Method PaymentMethod
}

// MakePayment processes the payment using the provided PaymentMethod
func (pp *PaymentProcessor) MakePayment(amount float64) {
    pp.Method.ProcessPayment(amount)
}

func main() {
    // Using UPI Payment method
    paymentUpi := Payment{Amount: 1200, Name: "Sabya", Date: "2024-11-15", PaymentMethod: "UPI"}
    paymentProcessorUpi := PaymentProcessor{Method: &UpiPayment{}}
    paymentProcessorUpi.MakePayment(paymentUpi.Amount)

    fmt.Println("\n---")

    // Using CreditCard Payment method
    paymentCreditCard := Payment{Amount: 1500, Name: "Ravi", Date: "2024-11-15", PaymentMethod: "CreditCard"}
    paymentProcessorCreditCard := PaymentProcessor{Method: &CreditCardPayment{}}
    paymentProcessorCreditCard.MakePayment(paymentCreditCard.Amount)

    fmt.Println("\n---")

    // Using RefundPayment, which violates LSP
    paymentRefund := Payment{Amount: 1500, Name: "Refund Case", Date: "2024-11-15", PaymentMethod: "Refund"}
    paymentProcessorRefund := PaymentProcessor{Method: &RefundPayment{}}
    paymentProcessorRefund.MakePayment(paymentRefund.Amount)  // This behaves incorrectly.
}
```

## Issues in This Flawed Example:
The RefundPayment Class Violates LSP:

The RefundPayment type is a subclass of PaymentMethod, but it doesn't behave like the other types (UpiPayment and CreditCardPayment) that process payments.
Instead of processing a payment, it outputs a message about initiating a refund without processing the payment.
This breaks the behavior expected from PaymentMethod, which is meant to process payments. When substituting RefundPayment for PaymentMethod, the logic becomes inconsistent, and the program's output is incorrect.

## Why This Violates LSP:
The PaymentProcessor expects any PaymentMethod (such as UpiPayment or CreditCardPayment) to process a payment.
However, when RefundPayment is substituted, the ProcessPayment method does not behave in the same way— it initiates a refund instead of processing a payment.
As a result, replacing one type with another breaks the expected behavior, which violates the Liskov Substitution Principle. The RefundPayment class does not behave as a proper substitution for other PaymentMethod classes in the context of the PaymentProcessor class.


## Liskov Substitution Principle in Action

- **Substitution**: In the main function, we demonstrate the Liskov Substitution Principle by substituting different payment types (UpiPayment and CreditCardPayment) into the PaymentProcessor. 
The PaymentProcessor doesn't need to know what type of PaymentMethod is being used—it just relies on the fact that the method ProcessPayment will be implemented.

- **Polymorphism**: You can replace UpiPayment with CreditCardPayment (or any future subclass implementing PaymentMethod) without modifying the PaymentProcessor or BillPrinter logic.
  This allows flexibility and extensibility without breaking existing code, demonstrating adherence to LSP.


## Benefits of Using LSP:
### Extensibility: 
You can easily add new payment methods (e.g., PayPalPayment, BitcoinPayment, etc.) by simply creating new structs that implement the PaymentMethod interface. 
No need to modify the PaymentProcessor class or BillPrinter class.

### Maintainability: 
Each class (UpiPayment, CreditCardPayment, etc.) is self-contained and adheres to a clear contract. Changes to one payment method won’t affect others.

### Testability: 
Each payment method can be independently tested by substituting a mock implementation of the PaymentMethod interface, ensuring that the core logic in PaymentProcessor and BillPrinter remains unaffected.

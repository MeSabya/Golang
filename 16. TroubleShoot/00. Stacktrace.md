In Go, when a program encounters a segmentation fault or encounters a condition that triggers a panic, 
Go will automatically print a stack trace to stderr. This stack trace includes information about where the panic occurred, including the file name, line number, and function name for each stack frame.

## runtime/debug package

The `runtime/debug` package in Go provides various debugging support functionalities, such as:

- Obtaining a stack trace
- Controlling the garbage collector
- Printing memory statistics
- Reading and setting the build information
- Retrieving the function's name and entry point

To obtain a stack trace of the current goroutine, you can use the `debug.Stack()` function, which returns a byte slice with the stack trace formatted as a string:

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime/debug"
)

func main() {
	stackTrace := debug.Stack()
	fmt.Printf("%s\n", stackTrace)
}
```
When you run this program, you will see the stack trace of the main goroutine:

```golang
$ go run main.go
goroutine 1 [running]:
runtime/debug.Stack()
	/usr/local/go/src/runtime/debug/stack.go:24 +0x65
main.main()
	/path/to/main.go:9 +0x5f
```

### Example1
```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func recursiveFunction(n int) {
	if n <= 0 {
		// Intentional bug: accessing index -1 of an empty slice
		slice := []int{}
		_ = slice[-1]
		return
	}
	recursiveFunction(n - 1)
}

func main() {
	defer func() {
		if r := recover(); r != nil {
			fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:")
			fmt.Println(r)
			fmt.Println("Stack trace:")
			fmt.Printf("%s", debug.Stack())
		}
	}()

	// Call the recursive function with an initial value
	recursiveFunction(5)
	fmt.Println("Program continues execution...")
}
```
When we run this program, it will panic due to the bug, but we've added a deferred function that recovers from the panic and prints a stack trace using debug.Stack(). 
This will help us identify exactly where in the recursive function the panic occurred and trace the sequence of function calls that led to the panic.

### Example2

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime/debug"
)

func main() {
	defer func() {
		if r := recover(); r != nil {
			fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
			debug.PrintStack()
		}
	}()

	// Simulate a runtime error by accessing an out-of-bounds index
	var arr []int
	fmt.Println(arr[10])
}
```
### use of stack traces in a concurrent program with multiple goroutines

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"runtime/debug"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Launch multiple goroutines
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)
		go func(id int) {
			defer wg.Done()

			// Simulate some work and potential errors
			time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(5)) * time.Second)
			if rand.Intn(2) == 0 {
				panic(fmt.Sprintf("Goroutine %d encountered an error", id))
			}
			fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d completed successfully\n", id)
		}(i)
	}

	// Wait for all goroutines to finish
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("All goroutines completed")
}

func init() {
	// Recover from panics and print stack trace
	defer func() {
		if r := recover(); r != nil {
			fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
			debug.PrintStack()
		}
	}()
}
```
### why init function here?

The init function is used here to set up a deferred recovery mechanism to catch any panics that occur within the goroutines.

In Go, the init function is a special function that is automatically executed before the main function is called, and it is typically used for package initialization tasks.

In this example, we use the init function to set up a deferred recover call to catch panics from any goroutine in the program. 
By doing this, we ensure that if any goroutine panics, the panic will be caught, and we can handle it gracefully by printing the error message and the stack trace.

Using the init function in this way allows us to centralize the recovery mechanism and ensure that it is set up before any other code in the package is executed, including the main function. This helps to ensure that we can recover from panics in any part of the program, regardless of where they occur.

#### What is the flow of execution of  main,init function 
In Go, the flow of execution involving the main function and init functions is as follows:

ðŸ‘‰ Package Initialization: Before the main function is executed, all init functions in the package and its dependencies are executed. 
   These init functions are executed in the order in which they are declared within their respective packages.

main Function Execution: After all init functions have been executed, the main function is called and executed. This is the entry point of the program.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

**Package Initialization:**
- Each package can contain one or more init functions.
- init functions are executed automatically by the Go runtime before the main function is called.
- If a package contains multiple init functions, they are executed in the order they are declared.
- init functions are typically used for package-level initialization tasks such as setting up global variables, initializing data structures, or registering with other components.

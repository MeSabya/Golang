// Template for the min heap
```golang
package main

import (
	"container/heap"
)

// MinHeap structure initialization
type MinHeap []int

// newMinHeap function initializes an instance of MinHeap
func newMinHeap() *MinHeap {
	min := &MinHeap{}
	heap.Init(min)
	return min
}

// Len function returns the length of MinHeap
func (h MinHeap) Len() int {
    return len(h)
}

// Empty function returns true if empty, false otherwise
func (h MinHeap) Empty() bool {
    return len(h) == 0
}

// Less function compares two elements of the MinHeap given their indexes
func (h MinHeap) Less(i, j int) bool {
    return h[i] < h[j]
}

// Swap function swaps the values of the elements whose indices are given
func (h MinHeap) Swap(i, j int) {
    h[i], h[j] = h[j], h[i]
}

// Top function returns the element at the top of the MinHeap
func (h MinHeap) Top() int {
    return h[0]
}

// Push function pushes an element into the MinHeap
func (h *MinHeap) Push(x interface{}) {
	*h = append(*h, x.(int))
}

// Pop function pops the element at the top of the MinHeap
func (h *MinHeap) Pop() interface{} {
	old := *h
	n := len(old)
	x := old[n-1]
	*h = old[0 : n-1]
	return x
}
```
Check the above pop method, we are trying to return the last element x := old[n-1]. 
Instead of this we can also return the first element also , in that case we need to heapify the heap again....

```golang
func (h *MaxHeap) Pop() interface{} {
    old := *h
    n := len(old)
    x := old[0]
    *h = old[0 : n-1]
    heapifyDown(*h, 1) // Reorganize the heap after removing the root
    return x
}

func heapifyDown(h MaxHeap, i int) {
    n := len(h)
    for {
        left := 2*i + 1
        right := 2*i + 2
        largest := i

        if left < n && h[left] > h[largest] {
            largest = left
        }
        if right < n && h[right] > h[largest] {
            largest = right
        }

        if largest == i {
            break
        }

        h[i], h[largest] = h[largest], h[i]
        i = largest
    }
}
```
When performing a Pop operation in a binary heap (such as a max-heap or min-heap), you're removing and returning the element at the root (0th index) of the heap. The time complexity for this operation is O(log n), where "n" is the number of elements in the heap. The reason for the O(log n) complexity is that you need to restore the heap property by performing a series of comparisons and swaps as you move elements down the heap to find their correct positions.

This time complexity holds true regardless of whether you are deleting the 0th index element or the nth index element during a Pop operation in the heap because the primary work of reorganizing the heap depends on the height of the heap (log n).

So, whether you are removing the root element (0th index) or an arbitrary element (nth index) during a Pop operation, the time complexity remains O(log n) in a binary heap.

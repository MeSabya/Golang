## Ginkgo
Ginkgo is a behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework for Go that helps structure tests with a clear and consistent hierarchy.

### 1.Test Suites and ginkgo.Describe:

Ginkgo organizes tests into suites which can be run independently.
Each suite is defined with Describe, which groups related test cases. Within each Describe block, you can create subgroups and individual test cases.

### 2.Test Cases with ginkgo.It:

Each It block represents a single test case. Descriptions are in the form of assertions like “It should [expected behavior]”.
This approach makes test cases easy to read and gives a behavior-driven structure to the tests.

### 3.Setup and Teardown with BeforeEach, AfterEach, BeforeSuite, and AfterSuite:

BeforeEach and AfterEach set up and clean up resources for each test case within a Describe.
BeforeSuite and AfterSuite handle setup and teardown at the suite level (before or after all test cases in the suite).
These functions help isolate test cases and manage resources properly.

### 4.Focused Tests with FIt, FDescribe, etc.:

Use focused versions of It, Describe, etc., to run only specific tests (e.g., FIt, FDescribe). This is helpful when debugging specific tests.
Remember to remove focus markers before finalizing tests, as they can unintentionally omit other test cases.

### 5.Pending and Skipping Tests:

PIt and PDescribe mark tests as pending, excluding them from the test run without deleting the code.
Skip can also be used within a test to conditionally skip execution based on certain criteria.

### 5.Asynchronous Testing with ginkgo.By and Eventually:

By provides additional context in test output, describing steps within an It block.
Eventually helps test code with asynchronous operations, repeatedly checking an assertion until a timeout is reached.

## Gomega
Gomega is a matcher/assertion library that complements Ginkgo by providing expressive assertions.

### 1. Matchers (Expect):

Gomega’s Expect function is the main way to write assertions, followed by matchers like To, NotTo, and specific matchers (e.g., Equal, ContainSubstring, HaveLen).
These matchers make assertions more expressive and readable, with clear explanations of the expected behavior.

### 2. Asynchronous Testing with Eventually and Consistently:

Eventually repeatedly checks a condition over time until it’s met or times out. It’s useful for asserting on asynchronous operations.
Consistently asserts that a condition remains true over a specified period, ensuring stability.
Both functions allow specifying polling intervals and timeouts.

### 3.Custom Matchers:

Gomega allows creating custom matchers for reusable, expressive assertions.
Custom matchers are helpful when you need assertions that aren’t covered by default Gomega matchers.

### 4. Error Handling with HaveOccurred and Succeed:

HaveOccurred and Succeed handle assertions on errors. HaveOccurred checks if an error was returned, while Succeed asserts no error was returned.
These are commonly used in cases where operations might fail or succeed unexpectedly.

### 5. Combining Matchers with And and Or:

Gomega provides And and Or for combining multiple matchers into a single assertion.
This is useful when multiple conditions need to be met (or at least one).

## Example

***counter.go***

```golang
package counter

import "time"

type Counter struct {
	value int
}

func NewCounter() *Counter {
	return &Counter{value: 0}
}

func (c *Counter) Increment() {
	c.value++
}

func (c *Counter) AsyncIncrement() {
	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
			time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
			c.value++
		}
	}()
}

func (c *Counter) Reset() {
	c.value = 0
}

func (c *Counter) Value() int {
	return c.value
}
```

***counter_test.go***

```golang
package counter_test

import (
	"counter-example"
	"testing"

	. "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2"
	. "github.com/onsi/gomega"
)

func TestCounter(t *testing.T) {
	RegisterFailHandler(Fail)
	RunSpecs(t, "Counter Suite")
}

var _ = BeforeSuite(func() {})
var _ = AfterSuite(func() {})

var _ = Describe("Counter", func() {
	var c *counter.Counter

	BeforeEach(func() {
		c = counter.NewCounter()
	})
	AfterEach(func() {
		c.Reset()
	})

	Describe("Incrementing", func() {
		It("Should Increment value by 1 ", func() {
			c.Increment()
			Expect(c.Value()).To(Equal(1))
		})

		It("Should increment twice", func() {
			c.Increment()
			c.Increment()
			Expect(c.Value()).To(Equal(2))
		})

		It("Checking async increment", func() {
			c.AsyncIncrement()
			Eventually(func() int { return c.Value() }, "1s", "100ms").Should(Equal(3))
		})
	})

})
```

## Why graceful shutdown is needed (in simple terms)

Graceful shutdown = stop safely, not suddenly.

In real systems, your process is killed regularly:

- Kubernetes pod restart
- Deployment rollout
- Auto-scaling
- Node drain
- Crash recovery

If you don’t handle shutdown → work is cut in the middle.

### Kubernetes will SIGKILL you

Timeline in Kubernetes:

```
SIGTERM → wait (30s default) → SIGKILL
```

If your app:

- ignores SIGTERM
- doesn’t stop work
- doesn’t exit on time
- Kubernetes force kills the process.
- No cleanup. No logs. No mercy.

### Minimal graceful shutdown checklist (interview gold)

- ✔ Listen for SIGTERM
- ✔ Stop accepting new traffic
- ✔ Cancel contexts
- ✔ Let goroutines exit
- ✔ Wait (with timeout)
- ✔ Exit cleanly

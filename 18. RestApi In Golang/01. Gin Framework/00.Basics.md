## Gin Framework

Have you ever wondered what was running under the hood of the following snippet:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/hello", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprint(w, "hello world\n")
	})
	http.ListenAndServe(":8089", nil)
}
```

### Here is the work flow of a Go web server:

- Create a socket listening on a port and wait for requests.
- Accept requests from clients.
- Handle requests, read HTTP Header and Body(if POST method) then pass it to Handlers.
- Finally, socket returns response to clients.

## How would you implement a basic REST API using Gin? Provide an example of a GET and POST endpoint.What is the difference between c.JSON, c.String, and c.HTML in Gin? When would you use each?

```golang
package main

import (
	"net/http"
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

type User struct {
	ID   int    `json:"id"`
	Name string `json:"name"`
	Age  int    `json:"age"`
}

var users = []User{
	{ID: 1, Name: "Alice", Age: 25},
	{ID: 2, Name: "Bob", Age: 30},
}

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()

	// GET endpoint: Retrieve all users
	r.GET("/users", func(c *gin.Context) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusOK, users)
	})

	// POST endpoint: Create a new user
	r.POST("/users", func(c *gin.Context) {
		var newUser User
		if err := c.ShouldBindJSON(&newUser); err != nil {
			c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": err.Error()})
			return
		}
		newUser.ID = len(users) + 1
		users = append(users, newUser)
		c.JSON(http.StatusCreated, newUser)
	})

	r.Run(":8080") // Start the server on port 8080
}
```

### What is gin.Default()
It creates a new Gin router instance with default middleware already attached.
Attached default Middleware: By default, it includes two middleware functions:

#### Logger Middleware:
- Logs details about each HTTP request, such as method, path, status code, latency, etc.
- Useful for debugging and monitoring incoming requests.

#### Recovery Middleware:
- Recovers from any panic in the application.
- Prevents the server from crashing and returns a proper HTTP 500 response.

ðŸ‘‰ The following is conceptually equivalent to calling gin.Default():

```golang
func Default() *gin.Engine {
    r := gin.New() // Create a new router without middleware
    r.Use(gin.Logger())   // Add Logger middleware
    r.Use(gin.Recovery()) // Add Recovery middleware
    return r
}
```


## Gin Router Vs http server

### Gin Router
The Gin router (*gin.Engine) is responsible for routing HTTP requests to the correct handler functions based on the request's URL path, HTTP method, and other parameters.

#### Core Responsibilities:

- Match incoming HTTP requests to the registered routes (GET, POST, etc.).
- Apply middleware to modify the request/response lifecycle.
- Delegate the request to the appropriate handler function.

### HTTP Server

#### Core Responsibilities:
- Low-level network communication.
- Conforming to the HTTP protocol.
- In Go, the HTTP server is typically represented by the http.Server struct from the net/http package.

### Simplified Flow:

- The HTTP server listens on a port (e.g., 8080).
- When a request is received, it passes the request to the Gin router.
- The Gin router matches the request to a route and executes the appropriate handler.

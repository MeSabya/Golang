## Select Vs sync.WaitGroup 
select and sync.WaitGroup are both concurrency control mechanisms in Go, but they serve different purposes.

### Select Statement:

- It allows a goroutine to wait on multiple channels and proceed as soon as one of them is ready.
- It's often used in scenarios where you have multiple channels and you want to perform non-blocking communication.

Example: Waiting for input on multiple channels, handling timeouts, or selecting the first available resource.

```golang
select {
case msg1 := <-ch1:
    // handle msg1
case msg2 := <-ch2:
    // handle msg2
default:
    // executed if no communication on any channel
}
```
### sync.WaitGroup:

- sync.WaitGroup is used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish their execution.
- It's particularly useful when you have a batch of goroutines, and you want to wait for all of them to complete before proceeding.
- Example: Waiting for a group of goroutines to finish their work.

```golang
var wg sync.WaitGroup

for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(i int) {
        defer wg.Done()
        // do some work in goroutine i
    }(i)
}

// Wait for all goroutines to finish
wg.Wait()
```
## What will happen if we dont use select when we have multiple channels

If you don't use a select statement when dealing with multiple channels in Go, and none of the channels are ready for communication, the program may block on the communication operation. This can lead to a deadlock or the program becoming unresponsive.

Consider the following example where we have two channels, ch1 and ch2, and we attempt to receive messages from both channels without using select:

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ch1 := make(chan string)
	ch2 := make(chan string)

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		ch1 <- "Message from ch1"
	}()

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
		ch2 <- "Message from ch2"
	}()

	// Attempt to receive from both channels without select
	msg1 := <-ch1
	msg2 := <-ch2

	fmt.Println("Received from ch1:", msg1)
	fmt.Println("Received from ch2:", msg2)
}
```
In this example:

```
msg1 := <-ch1 attempts to receive a message from ch1.
msg2 := <-ch2 attempts to receive a message from ch2.
```

However, the order in which these receives occur is not guaranteed, and if ch1 takes longer to produce a message than ch2, the program will deadlock. The second receive operation will be waiting indefinitely for a value on ch2, and the program will not progress.

To handle this situation and avoid potential deadlocks, it's advisable to use the select statement, which allows the program to wait on multiple communication operations and proceed as soon as one of them is ready. Here's how you could modify the above example using select:

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ch1 := make(chan string)
	ch2 := make(chan string)

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		ch1 <- "Message from ch1"
	}()

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
		ch2 <- "Message from ch2"
	}()

	// Use select to wait for either ch1 or ch2 to receive a message
	select {
	case msg1 := <-ch1:
		fmt.Println("Received from ch1:", msg1)
	case msg2 := <-ch2:
		fmt.Println("Received from ch2:", msg2)
	case <-time.After(3 * time.Second):
		fmt.Println("Timeout: No message received in 3 seconds")
	}
}
```
In this version, the select statement allows the program to handle the case where neither ch1 nor ch2 is ready, avoiding potential deadlocks and providing more flexibility in handling multiple channels.

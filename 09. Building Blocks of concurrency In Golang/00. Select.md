## Select Vs sync.WaitGroup 
select and sync.WaitGroup are both concurrency control mechanisms in Go, but they serve different purposes.

### Select Statement:

- It allows a goroutine to wait on multiple channels and proceed as soon as one of them is ready.
- It's often used in scenarios where you have multiple channels and you want to perform non-blocking communication.

Example: Waiting for input on multiple channels, handling timeouts, or selecting the first available resource.

```golang
select {
case msg1 := <-ch1:
    // handle msg1
case msg2 := <-ch2:
    // handle msg2
default:
    // executed if no communication on any channel
}
```
### sync.WaitGroup:

- sync.WaitGroup is used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish their execution.
- It's particularly useful when you have a batch of goroutines, and you want to wait for all of them to complete before proceeding.
- Example: Waiting for a group of goroutines to finish their work.

```golang
var wg sync.WaitGroup

for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(i int) {
        defer wg.Done()
        // do some work in goroutine i
    }(i)
}

// Wait for all goroutines to finish
wg.Wait()
```
## What are the problems solved by Select statement in golang.
Here are the key problems that select solves:

### Multiplexing Operations: 
With Select, you can wait on multiple channels at once. This is useful when you have several channels and want to perform different actions based on which channel has data available or is ready for communication.

```golang
package main
import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "sync"
    "time"
)
func main() {
    ashleyMsg := make(chan string)
    brianMsg := make(chan string)
    exit := make(chan struct{})
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    go func() {
        numJob := rand.Intn(10)
        fmt.Println("number of jobs:", numJob)
        for i := 0; i < numJob; i++ {
            wg.Add(2)
            go func() {
                defer wg.Done()
                time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(10)) * time.Millisecond)
                ashleyMsg <- "hi"
            }()
            go func() {
                defer wg.Done()
                time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(10)) * time.Millisecond)
                brianMsg <- "what's up"
            }()
        }
        wg.Wait()
        close(exit)
    }()
    for {
        select {
        case res1 := <-ashleyMsg:
            fmt.Println("ashley:", res1)
        case res2 := <-brianMsg:
            fmt.Println("brian:", res2)
        case <-exit:
            fmt.Println("chat ended")
            return
        default:
            fmt.Println("...")
            time.Sleep(time.Millisecond)
        }
    }
}
```

### Non-blocking Communication: 
select enables non-blocking communication by allowing you to perform other tasks if none of the channels are ready. This prevents your program from blocking indefinitely while waiting for communication on a single channel.

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ch1 := make(chan string)
	ch2 := make(chan string)

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		ch1 <- "Message from ch1"
	}()

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
		ch2 <- "Message from ch2"
	}()

	for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
		select {
		case msg1 := <-ch1:
			fmt.Println("Received from ch1:", msg1)
		case msg2 := <-ch2:
			fmt.Println("Received from ch2:", msg2)
		default:
			fmt.Println("No message received yet")
			time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
		}
	}
}
```


Without select, the main goroutine would need to wait for messages from both channels sequentially. This means that if one channel has a message available while the other does not, the main goroutine would be blocked until a message is received from the second channel. This can lead to inefficient resource utilization, especially if the program needs to perform other tasks while waiting for messages.

Additionally, without select, there is no way to handle multiple channels concurrently. The main goroutine would have to wait on each channel individually, leading to potential delays and increased complexity in the code.

### Timeout Handling: 
It facilitates timeout handling by allowing you to include a default case in the select statement, which gets executed if no other communication operation is ready within a specified time limit.

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func worker1(ch chan<- int) {
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	ch <- 1
}

func worker2(ch chan<- int) {
	time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
	ch <- 2
}

func main() {
	ch1 := make(chan int)
	ch2 := make(chan int)

	go worker1(ch1)
	go worker2(ch2)

	select {
	case result := <-ch1:
		fmt.Println("Received result from worker1:", result)
	case result := <-ch2:
		fmt.Println("Received result from worker2:", result)
	case <-time.After(1 * time.Second):
		fmt.Println("Timeout: No results received within 1 second")
	}
}
```

### Preventing Deadlocks: 
select can be used to prevent deadlocks in situations where multiple channels are involved in communication. By structuring your code properly with select, you can avoid scenarios where goroutines are blocked indefinitely waiting for communication that may never occur.

Overall, select provides a powerful mechanism for managing concurrent communication in Go programs, allowing them to efficiently handle multiple channels and react appropriately based on the availability of communication operations.

```golang
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    c := make(chan int)
    select {
    case <-c: // this case will never be selected because of deadlock
        fmt.Println("received") // this will never be printed
    }
}
```
#### Solution to the above code
```golang
//handling deadlock in Go with Default case in Select statement
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    c := make(chan int)
    select {
    case <-c: // this case will never be selected because of deadlock
        fmt.Println("received") // this will never be printed
    default: //default case is executed if no other case is selected
        fmt.Println("default case...")
    }
}
```

The generator pattern typically involves using a goroutine to produce values and a channel to communicate those values to the consumer.

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func numberGenerator(stopCh chan struct{}) <-chan int {
	numCh := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		defer close(numCh) // Close the channel when the goroutine exits

		for i := 1; ; i++ {
			select {
			case numCh <- i:
				// Send the current number to the channel
			case <-stopCh:
				// Stop the generator when the stopCh is closed
				return
			}

			time.Sleep(time.Second) // Simulate some work
		}
	}()

	return numCh
}

func main() {
	stopCh := make(chan struct{})
	defer close(stopCh) // Close the stop channel when the program exits

	numCh := numberGenerator(stopCh)

	// Consume values from the generator for 5 seconds
	timeout := time.After(5 * time.Second)
	for {
		select {
		case num := <-numCh:
			fmt.Println(num)
		case <-timeout:
			fmt.Println("Timeout: Program will exit after 5 seconds.")
			return
		}
	}
}
```
**what is the meaning of stopCh := make(chan struct{})**

stopCh is a channel of the empty struct{} type. This pattern is often used to create a signaling channel in Go. 
The struct{} type has zero size, meaning it doesn't carry any data, and it's commonly used when the signaling itself is the important information.

**why it is not called as numCh := go numberGenerator(stopCh)**

 In Go, a goroutine does not return a value directly. When you start a goroutine using the go keyword, the function call that is executed in the new goroutine does not return a value that can be directly captured by the caller.

```golang
func main(){
    var count int
    go func(){
        count++
        fmt.Println(count)
    }()
   go func(){
        count=2
        fmt.Println(count)
 }()
}
```
Above code produces No output, it's likely that the main function is exiting before the goroutines have a chance to execute. In Go, the main function doesn't wait for other goroutines to finish, so if they are not given enough time to execute, the program may exit before they print anything.

To ensure that the main goroutine waits for the other goroutines to finish, you can use synchronization mechanisms such as sync.WaitGroup. Here's an example:

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	var count int
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Goroutine 1
	wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		count++
		fmt.Println(count)
	}()

	// Goroutine 2
	wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		count = 2
		fmt.Println(count)
	}()

	// Wait for both goroutines to finish
	wg.Wait()
}
```

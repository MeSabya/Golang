## Deadlock in Go

Deadlocks can occur with both buffered and unbuffered channels in Go. The potential for a deadlock depends on how channels are used and how synchronization between goroutines is managed.

Here are scenarios where deadlocks can occur with both buffered and unbuffered channels:

```golang
package main

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int)

    // Attempting to send on an unbuffered channel without a corresponding receive
    ch <- 42

    // This line will never be reached
    println("This line will never be printed")
}
```

### Buffered Channel Deadlock:

```golang
package main

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int, 1)

    // Sending a value on a buffered channel without a corresponding receive
    ch <- 42

    // This line will never be reached
    println("This line will never be printed")
}
```

### Deadlock with Synchronization:

```golang
package main

import "sync"

func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    ch := make(chan int)

    wg.Add(1)
    go func() {
        defer wg.Done()
        // Attempting to receive from a channel without a corresponding send
        <-ch
    }()

    // This line will never be reached
    wg.Wait()
    println("This line will never be printed")
}
```
In this example, a WaitGroup is used for synchronization, and a deadlock occurs because there is no corresponding send operation on the channel.

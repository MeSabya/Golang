Closures in Go are a powerful and versatile feature that finds application in various real-world scenarios. Here are some common use cases where closures are employed:

### Function Factories:
Closures can be used to create function factories, where a function returns another function customized with specific behavior.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func multiplier(factor int) func(int) int {
    return func(x int) int {
        return x * factor
    }
}

func main() {
    // Create a closure that multiplies by 3
    multiplyBy3 := multiplier(3)

    // Use the closure
    result := multiplyBy3(5)
    fmt.Println(result) // Output: 15
}
```

### Maintaining State:
Closures can be used to maintain and encapsulate state across multiple function calls.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func counter() func() int {
    count := 0
    return func() int {
        count++
        return count
    }
}

func main() {
    // Create a closure that acts as a counter
    count := counter()

    // Use the closure
    fmt.Println(count()) // Output: 1
    fmt.Println(count()) // Output: 2
    fmt.Println(count()) // Output: 3
}
```

### Callbacks:
Closures are often used as callbacks in Go, providing a way to define custom behavior that can be passed to functions.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func processNumbers(numbers []int, callback func(int) int) {
    for _, num := range numbers {
        result := callback(num)
        fmt.Println(result)
    }
}

func main() {
    // Create a closure for doubling numbers
    double := func(x int) int {
        return x * 2
    }

    // Use the closure as a callback
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
    processNumbers(numbers, double)
}
```

### Encapsulation and Scope:
Closures allow encapsulation of variables within a limited scope, preventing them from being accessed outside of the closure.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func createCounter() func() int {
    count := 0
    return func() int {
        count++
        return count
    }
}

func main() {
    // Create a closure that acts as a counter
    counter := createCounter()

    // The count variable is encapsulated within the closure
    // and cannot be accessed from outside
    fmt.Println(counter()) // Output: 1
    fmt.Println(counter()) // Output: 2
}
```

## How can you achieve code reuse and polymorphism in Go without using classical inheritance?

### Composition:

Go encourages composition over inheritance. You can embed one struct into another to reuse its fields and methods.
Composition allows you to create new types by combining existing ones.

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

// Animal struct represents a basic animal
type Animal struct {
    Name string
}

// Speak method for Animal
func (a *Animal) Speak() {
    fmt.Println("Generic animal sound")
}

// Dog struct embeds Animal
type Dog struct {
    Animal
    Breed string
}

// Speak method for Dog overrides Animal's Speak
func (d *Dog) Speak() {
    fmt.Println("Woof!")
}

func main() {
    animal := &Animal{Name: "Generic Animal"}
    dog := &Dog{Animal: Animal{Name: "Buddy"}, Breed: "Labrador"}

    animal.Speak() // Generic animal sound
    dog.Speak()    // Woof!
}
```

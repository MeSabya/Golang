## Type Assertion:
Syntax:

```go
value, ok := expression.(Type)
```
Type assertion is used to extract the underlying value from an interface and check whether the underlying type is of a specific type.
The optional second return value (ok) is a boolean that indicates whether the assertion was successful.
Type assertion can be used with interfaces to retrieve the underlying concrete type and access its fields or methods.

Example:

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func printValue(value interface{}) {
    // Type assertion to check if the underlying type is int
    if intValue, ok := value.(int); ok {
        fmt.Println("Received an integer:", intValue)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Not an integer")
    }
}

func main() {
    printValue(42)
    printValue("hello")
}
```
## Type Switch:
Syntax:

```go
switch value := expression.(type) {
case Type1:
    // Code when expression is of Type1
case Type2:
    // Code when expression is of Type2
// ...
default:
    // Code when expression is of a type not listed
}
```
Type switch is an extension of the regular switch statement that works with types instead of values.
It allows you to compare the type of an expression against multiple types and execute different code blocks based on the match.
The special syntax (type) is used within the switch statement to perform type assertion.

Example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func printType(value interface{}) {
    // Type switch to check the underlying type
    switch v := value.(type) {
    case int:
        fmt.Println("Type is int")
    case string:
        fmt.Println("Type is string")
    default:
        fmt.Printf("Type is unknown: %T\n", v)
    }
}

func main() {
    printType(42)
    printType("hello")
    printType(3.14)
}
```
## Type Assertion and Type Switch in Polymorphism:

Type assertion and type switch allow you to discover and work with the concrete types that satisfy an interface.
This enables polymorphism by allowing you to interact with objects based on their shared behavior (interface) rather than their concrete types.
Type assertion and type switch are often used to handle different types in a flexible and polymorphic way.
Example:

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

// Speaker interface defines a common behavior
type Speaker interface {
    Speak()
}

// Dog type satisfies the Speaker interface
type Dog struct{}

// Speak method for Dog
func (d Dog) Speak() {
    fmt.Println("Woof!")
}

// Cat type satisfies the Speaker interface
type Cat struct{}

// Speak method for Cat
func (c Cat) Speak() {
    fmt.Println("Meow!")
}

func main() {
    // Create instances of Dog and Cat
    dog := Dog{}
    cat := Cat{}

    // Use the Speaker interface polymorphically
    speakPolymorphically(dog)
    speakPolymorphically(cat)
}

// speakPolymorphically uses the Speaker interface polymorphically
func speakPolymorphically(speaker Speaker) {
    // Type switch to handle different types
    switch v := speaker.(type) {
    case Dog:
        fmt.Println("It's a dog!")
    case Cat:
        fmt.Println("It's a cat!")
    default:
        fmt.Printf("Unknown type: %T\n", v)
    }

    // Direct call to the Speak method
    speaker.Speak()
}
```

## Go panicking

If panic is called from a nested function, it immediately stops the execution of the current function; all defer statements are guaranteed to execute. Then, control is given to the function caller, which receives this call to panic. This bubbles up to the top level, executing defers, and at the top of the stack, the program crashes. The error condition is reported on the command-line using the value given to panic; this termination sequence is called panicking.


## What is recover() function?

The recover function in Go is used in conjunction with panic to manage unexpected errors and ensure that a program can gracefully handle runtime panics. Here's its significance:

- Panic Recovery: When a panic occurs, it halts the normal flow of execution. Using recover inside a deferred function allows you to regain control after a panic.
- Graceful Shutdown: It allows the program to clean up resources or log errors before exiting.
- Error Handling: It enables better error reporting and handling mechanisms in concurrent or long-running systems.

As the name indicates, this built-in function can be used to recover from a panic or an error-condition: it allows a program to regain control of a panicking Go routine, stopping the terminating sequence and resuming normal execution. The recover is only useful when called inside a deferred function: it then retrieves the error value passed through the call to panic. When used in normal execution, a call to recover will return nil and have no other effect. The panic causes the stack to unwind until a deferred recover() is found or the program terminates.

```go
package main
import (
  "fmt"
)

func badCall() {
  panic("bad end")
}

func test() {
  defer func() {
    if e := recover(); e != nil {
      fmt.Printf("Panicking %s\r\n", e);
    }
  }()
  badCall()
  fmt.Printf("After bad call\r\n");
}

func main() {
  fmt.Printf("Calling test\r\n");
  test()
  fmt.Printf("Test completed\r\n");
}
```

To follow the flow of the program, look at its output:

```
Calling test
Panicking bad end
Test completed
```
Letâ€™s see how we got here. At the start, Calling test will be printed from line 21 in main() function. Then, control goes to line 22, where test() is called.

This starts with a defer of an anonymous function (implemented from line 11 to line 15); this will not be executed now. badCall() is called at line 16, which causes a panic at line 7, and After bad call (from line 17) is never printed.

Normally, the program stops here, but if there is a remaining defer, this is executed first before the panic starts its actions. At line 12, the recover stops the panic and stores its error in e. Its message is printed at line 13, which is the 2nd output line. 
Because the panic is recovered, test() completes normally, and the end message Test completed is printed.

Defer, panic and recover in a sense are also control-flow mechanisms, like if, for, etc. This mechanism is used at several places in the Go standard library, e.g., in the json package when decoding or in the regexp package in the Compile function. The convention in the Go libraries is that even when a package uses panic internally, a recover is done so that its external API still presents explicit error return values.

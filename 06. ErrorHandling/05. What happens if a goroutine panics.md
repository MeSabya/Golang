## What happens if a goroutine panics? How can you recover from it gracefully? 

How to Recover from a Panic Gracefully
To handle a panic in a goroutine:

- Use the recover function inside a defer statement to catch the panic and handle it gracefully.
- Log the error or take corrective action to maintain application stability.
- Ensure the panic does not propagate to affect other parts of the application.

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func safeGo(f func()) {
	// Start a goroutine with a recovery mechanism
	go func() {
		defer func() {
			if r := recover(); r != nil {
				// Handle the panic
				fmt.Printf("Recovered from panic: %v\n", r)
			}
		}()
		f() // Execute the function
	}()
}

func main() {
	safeGo(func() {
		fmt.Println("Goroutine 1 starting...")
		panic("Something went wrong in Goroutine 1!") // This panic will be recovered
	})

	safeGo(func() {
		fmt.Println("Goroutine 2 starting...")
		// Normal execution
		time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
		fmt.Println("Goroutine 2 completed successfully!")
	})

	// Give the goroutines time to complete
	time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
	fmt.Println("Main function exiting...")
}
```

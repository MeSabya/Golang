## Anonymous Closure

Passing anonymous closure through a channel
Functions are values in Go, and so are closures. So, we can construct a channel c, whose data type is a function, as in the following example:

```golang
package main
import "fmt"

func prod(c chan func()) {
  f := <- c
  f()
  c <- nil
}

func main() {
  c := make(chan func())
  go prod(c)
  x := 0
  c <- func() { // puts a closure in channel c
    x++
  }
  fmt.Println(x)
}
```
The output of this program is 1. At line 11, you can see how to make channel c with lambdas: c := make(chan func()). Then, at line 12, we start a goroutine by passing c to it. Executing the prod() function, this is implemented from line 4 to line 8.

Back to main() at line 13, an integer x is defined. In the commented line 14, an anonymous closure, capturing the value of x, is sent to the channel c. The closure increments x.

The goroutine that executes the function prod reads that closure f from the channel at line 5 and calls it at line 6. This increments the value of x from 0 to 1. Then at line 7, we put nil on the channel. The net result is that x gets the value 1.

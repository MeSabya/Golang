In Go, the select statement is a language construct used for working with multiple channel operations concurrently.
It allows a Go program to wait for communication on multiple channels simultaneously and execute code based on the first 
channel operation that becomes available. The select statement is similar to the switch statement, 
but it deals with communication actions on channels, such as sending or receiving data.

## Syntax
```golang
select {
case <-channel1:
    // Code to be executed when channel1 is ready for receive
case channel2 <- value:
    // Code to be executed when channel2 is ready for send
default:
    // Code to be executed when no case is ready
}
```
## Describe a scenario where a select statement with multiple cases can block indefinitely, and explain how to avoid this situation.
Here's an example to illustrate this scenario:

### Example1
```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ch1 := make(chan int)
	ch2 := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second) // Simulating some work
		ch1 <- 1
	}()

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second) // Simulating some work
		ch2 <- 2
	}()

	select {
	case <-ch1:
		fmt.Println("Received from ch1")
	case <-ch2:
		fmt.Println("Received from ch2")
	}
}
```
In this example, we have two goroutines sending values on ch1 and ch2 channels after some delay. 
However, the select statement in the main function will block indefinitely because both channels are not 
immediately ready to receive a value, and there's no default case to handle this situation.

To avoid this situation, we can use a default case in the select statement to handle the scenario where none of the channel operations are ready. 
Here's how we can modify the example to handle this:

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	ch1 := make(chan int)
	ch2 := make(chan int)

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second) // Simulating some work
		ch1 <- 1
	}()

	go func() {
		time.Sleep(time.Second) // Simulating some work
		ch2 <- 2
	}()

	select {
	case <-ch1:
		fmt.Println("Received from ch1")
	case <-ch2:
		fmt.Println("Received from ch2")
	default:
		fmt.Println("No data received from any channel")
	}
}
```
### Example2:

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func worker1(ch chan<- int) {
	time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
	ch <- 1
}

func worker2(ch chan<- int) {
	time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
	ch <- 2
}

func main() {
	ch1 := make(chan int)
	ch2 := make(chan int)

	go worker1(ch1)
	go worker2(ch2)

	select {
	case result := <-ch1:
		fmt.Println("Received result from worker1:", result)
	case result := <-ch2:
		fmt.Println("Received result from worker2:", result)
	case <-time.After(1 * time.Second):
		fmt.Println("Timeout: No results received within 1 second")
	}
}
```

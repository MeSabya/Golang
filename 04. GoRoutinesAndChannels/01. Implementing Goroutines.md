## Implementing Goroutines

Go does not parallelize code by default. Only a single core or processor is dedicated to a Go-program, regardless of how many goroutines are started in it.
Therefore, these goroutines are _running concurrently; they are not running in parallel, which means only one goroutine is running at a time. 
This will probably change, but until then, in order to let your program execute simultaneously with more cores so that goroutines are really running in parallel; 
you have to use the variable GOMAXPROCS. 
This tells the run-time how many goroutines can execute in parallel. For example, if you have 8 processors, you can at most run 8 goroutines in parallel.

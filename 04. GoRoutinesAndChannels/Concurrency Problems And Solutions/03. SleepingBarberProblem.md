Problem Statement:

Imagine a hypothetical barbershop with one barber, one barber chair, and
a waiting room with n chairs (n may be 0) for waiting customers.
The following rules apply:

1. If there are no customers, the barber falls asleep in the chair

2. A customer must wake the barber if he is asleep

3. If a customer arrives while the barber is working, the customer leaves if all
   chairs are occupied and sits in an empty chair if it's available

4. When the barber finishes a haircut, he inspects the waiting room to see if
   there are any waiting customers and falls asleep if there are none

*/

	// How to know he has slept ?

	// We need a mutex to protect the slept variable

Barber shop open and close case is not handled here.

Proper error handling is done here:

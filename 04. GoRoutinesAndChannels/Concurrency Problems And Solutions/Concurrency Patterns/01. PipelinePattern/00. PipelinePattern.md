It is commonly used in data processing tasks where you have multiple stages of operations that need to be performed concurrently on a stream of data. 
Here are some real-time use cases where this pattern is especially useful:

For example:

### 1. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Data Processing
Pipeline Stages:

- Extraction (fetching data)
- Transformation (applying business logic, aggregations, or enrichment)
- Loading (writing to storage or a data warehouse)
### 2. Image Processing Pipeline
Pipeline Stages:

- Loading the image from storage
- Resizing the image
- Applying various image filters
- Saving the processed image

### 3. Financial Transaction Processing
Pipeline Stages:

- Validation (checking data integrity)
- Authorization (validating with payment providers)
- Recording (logging the transaction in a database)

## Example of pipeline pattern

Here’s an example of a financial transaction processing pipeline using Go’s concurrency pipeline pattern. In this scenario, transactions move through several stages: validation, authorization, and recording. Each stage is processed concurrently to ensure high throughput and low latency.

Steps:

- Validation Stage – Verify transaction data, like checking amounts and account numbers.
- Authorization Stage – Communicate with the payment gateway or bank to authorize the transaction.
- Recording Stage – Log the completed transaction to the database.

```pipeline.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

type Transaction struct {
	ID     int
	Amount float64
	Status string
}

// Stage 1: Validate transactions
func validateTransactions(transactions <-chan Transaction) <-chan Transaction {
	out := make(chan Transaction)
	go func() {
		defer close(out)
		for txn := range transactions {
			if txn.Amount > 0 {
				txn.Status = "Validated"
				fmt.Printf("Validated transaction %d\n", txn.ID)
				out <- txn
			} else {
				fmt.Printf("Invalid transaction %d\n", txn.ID)
			}
		}
	}()
	return out
}

// Stage 2: Authorize transactions
func authorizeTransactions(transactions <-chan Transaction) <-chan Transaction {
	out := make(chan Transaction)
	go func() {
		defer close(out)
		for txn := range transactions {
			// Simulate a random authorization delay
			time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(100)) * time.Millisecond)
			txn.Status = "Authorized"
			fmt.Printf("Authorized transaction %d\n", txn.ID)
			out <- txn
		}
	}()
	return out
}

// Stage 3: Record transactions
func recordTransactions(transactions <-chan Transaction, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()
	for txn := range transactions {
		// Simulate database recording
		time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(50)) * time.Millisecond)
		txn.Status = "Recorded"
		fmt.Printf("Recorded transaction %d\n", txn.ID)
	}
}

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	// Initialize the wait group
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	// Create the input channel with sample transactions
	transactions := make(chan Transaction)
	go func() {
		for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {
			transactions <- Transaction{ID: i, Amount: float64(rand.Intn(1000) + 1)}
		}
		close(transactions)
	}()

	// Set up the pipeline stages
	validated := validateTransactions(transactions)
	authorized := authorizeTransactions(validated)

	// Record the authorized transactions
	wg.Add(1)
	go recordTransactions(authorized, &wg)

	// Wait for all transactions to be processed
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("All transactions processed.")
}
```

```pipeline_test.go
package main

import "testing"

func TestValidateTransaction(t *testing.T) {
	input := make(chan Transaction)
	output := validateTransaction(input)

	go func() {
		input <- Transaction{ID: 1, Amount: 100}
		input <- Transaction{ID: 2, Amount: -50}
		input <- Transaction{ID: 3, Amount: 200}

		close(input)
	}()

	var results []Transaction
	for txn := range output {
		results = append(results, txn)
	}

	if len(results) != 2 {
		t.Errorf("Expected 2 valid transactions, got %d", len(results))
	}

	if results[0].ID != 1 || results[1].ID != 3 {
		t.Error("Validation did not pass expected transactions")
	}
}
```

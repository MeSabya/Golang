# Fanout and Fanin Pattern
It is particularly useful when you have a time-consuming task that can be divided into smaller subtasks that can be executed concurrently.

## How it works
The pattern consists of two main stages: fan-out and fan-in.

- Fan-out: In the fan-out stage, a single task is divided into multiple smaller subtasks, which are then executed concurrently. 
  Each subtask can be assigned to a separate goroutine (lightweight concurrent thread in Go) to run in parallel. 
  This stage distributes the workload across multiple goroutines, allowing for parallel processing.

- Fan-in: In the fan-in stage, the results or outputs from all the concurrently executing subtasks are collected and combined into a single result. 
  This stage waits for all the subtasks to complete and aggregates their results. The fan-in stage can also handle synchronization and 
  coordination between the goroutines to ensure that all results are collected before proceeding.

## How to implement
The fan-out/fan-in pattern is typically implemented using a combination of goroutines and channels in Go. Each subtask is assigned to a goroutine, 
and channels are used to pass data between the goroutines. The fan-in stage waits for the completion of all subtasks by
coordinating through synchronization primitives like WaitGroups or using a channel to signal the completion of each subtask.

## Code
Below is the example that demonstrates the fan-out/fan-in pattern in Go:

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

// worker performs the task on jobs received and sends results to the results channel.
func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
	for job := range jobs {
		// Perform the task here
		result := job * 2
		results <- result
	}
}

func main() {
	numJobs := 10
	numWorkers := 4

	// Create buffered channels for jobs and results
	jobs := make(chan int, numJobs)
	results := make(chan int, numJobs)

	// Fan-out: Create worker goroutines
	for w := 1; w <= numWorkers; w++ {
		go worker(w, jobs, results)
	}

	// Produce jobs
	for j := 1; j <= numJobs; j++ {
		jobs <- j
	}
	close(jobs) // Close the jobs channel to signal no more jobs will be sent

	// Fan-in: Collect results
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(numJobs) // Set WaitGroup counter to the number of jobs

	// Launch a goroutine to wait for all jobs to finish
	go func() {
		wg.Wait()    // Wait for all jobs to be done
		close(results) // Close the results channel after all jobs are processed
	}()

	// Process results
	for result := range results {
		fmt.Println("Result:", result)
		wg.Done() // Decrease the WaitGroup counter as each result is processed
	}
}
```

## Some of followup questions on the above implmentation:

### 1. Why wait() has to be in separate goroutine?
```golang
go func() {
		wg.Wait()    // Wait for all jobs to be done
		close(results) // Close the results channel after all jobs are processed
	}()
```

If you were to move the wg.Wait() (or its equivalent) directly into the main function instead of placing it in a separate goroutine, 
main function will wait for all workers to finish (because wg.Wait() blocks the main function until the wg.Done() calls for each worker have been made).

### 2. What is the alternate to waitgroup? 

#### Approach1:
```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int, done chan<- struct{}) {
	for job := range jobs {
		result := job * 2
		results <- result
	}
	done <- struct{}{} // Send a signal when a worker is done
}

func main() {
	numJobs := 10
	numWorkers := 4

	jobs := make(chan int, numJobs)
	results := make(chan int, numJobs)
	done := make(chan struct{}, numWorkers) // Channel to signal completion of workers

	// Start worker goroutines
	for w := 1; w <= numWorkers; w++ {
		go worker(w, jobs, results, done)
	}

	// Send jobs to workers
	for j := 1; j <= numJobs; j++ {
		jobs <- j
	}
	close(jobs) // Close the jobs channel when done sending jobs

	// Use a goroutine to close the results channel after all workers are done
	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < numWorkers; i++ {
			<-done // Wait for all workers to signal completion
		}
		close(results) // Close the results channel after all workers are done
	}()

	// Receive results from the results channel
	for result := range results {
		fmt.Println("Result:", result)
	}
}
```

#### Approach2:
```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
	time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) // Simulate work
	result := id * 2
	results <- result
}

func main() {
	numJobs := 5
	numWorkers := 3

	jobs := make(chan int, numJobs)
	results := make(chan int, numJobs)

	// Start worker goroutines
	for w := 1; w <= numWorkers; w++ {
		go worker(w, jobs, results)
	}

	// Send jobs to workers
	for j := 1; j <= numJobs; j++ {
		jobs <- j
	}
	close(jobs) 
  close (results) // **Closing channel prematurely!** 
	// Read from results channel
	for result := range results {
		fmt.Println("Result:", result)
	}
}
```
### If we can solve using Approach2 why we need Approach1?
Without a WaitGroup, you are relying on an implicit synchronization through the flow of channels. Here's the risk:

- You could accidentally close the results channel while some workers are still sending data into it.
- The main function might attempt to process the results before all workers have finished, leading to an incomplete or inconsistent result set.

### Here we are closing results channel and then reading from a closed channel?

Key Points About Closing Channels:

- Closing a channel: Once a channel is closed, no more values can be sent to it. However, you can still receive values from it.
- Receiving from a closed channel: When you read from a closed channel, Go will return the zero value of the channel's type (e.g., 0 for an int channel), but it will also return false as the second value in the form value, ok if the channel is closed and empty.
  If the channel is closed and all values have been received, ok will be false. 

  Here The main function reads values from the results channel using a for loop (for result := range results),
  which continues until the results channel is closed and empty.

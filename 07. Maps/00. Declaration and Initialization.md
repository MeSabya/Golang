### Declaration and Initialization

- Maps are an unordered collection of pairs of items. 

- A map is a reference type.Maps are cheap to pass to a function because only a reference is passed

- The length of the map doesnâ€™t have to be known at the declaration, which means a map can grow dynamically. 

### Initialization of a map

```golang
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
  mapLit := map[string]int{"one": 1, "two": 2}   // making map & adding key-value pair
  var mapAssigned map[string]int
  mapCreated := make(map[string]float32)        // making map with make()
  mapAssigned = mapLit
  mapCreated["key1"] = 4.5      // creating key-value pair for map
  mapCreated["key2"] = 3.14159
  mapAssigned["two"] = 3        // changing value of already existing key
  fmt.Printf("Map literal at \"one\" is: %d\n", mapLit["one"])
  fmt.Printf("Map created at \"key2\" is: %f\n", mapCreated["key2"])
  fmt.Printf("Map assigned at \"two\" is: %d\n", mapAssigned["two"])
  fmt.Printf("Map literal at \"ten\" is: %d\n", mapLit["ten"])
}
```

```golang
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
  mf := map[int]func() int{ // key type int, and value type func()int
    1: func() int { return 10 },
    2: func() int { return 20 },
    5: func() int { return 50 },
  }
  fmt.Println(mf)
}
```
#### How to initialize an array of maps
We must use make() two times, first for the slice, then for each of the map-elements of the slice. To access a specific key-value pair from a map, you have to use an iterator to specify which map from the slice of maps is required.

```golang
package main
import (
"fmt"
)

func main() {

  // Version A:
  items := make([]map[int]int, 5)
  for i := range items {
    items[i] = make(map[int]int, 1) 
    items[i][1] = 2 // This 'item' data will not be lost on the next iteration
  }
  fmt.Printf("Version A: Value of items: %v\n", items)


  // Version B: NOT GOOD!

  items2 := make([]map[int]int, 5)
  for _, item := range items2 {
    item = make(map[int]int, 1) // item is only a copy of the slice element.
    item[1] = 2 // This 'item' will be lost on the next iteration.
  }
  fmt.Printf("Version B: Value of items: %v\n", items2)
}
```

### Why use empty struct as a value in a map, what is the significance?

Using struct{}{} for the values in a set (like the visited map) in Go is a common idiom. It is often referred to as using the "empty struct" trick. The reason for using an empty struct instead of a boolean value is primarily about efficiency and memory usage.

When you use struct{}{}, it represents a zero-sized value, meaning it takes up zero bytes of memory. This is a more memory-efficient way to represent a set of unique keys in a map. The keys themselves are important, and the fact that they exist in the map implies their presence in the set.

Here are some advantages of using struct{}{}:

#### Memory Efficiency: 
Using struct{}{} as the value type minimizes the memory overhead associated with each key in the set. In Go, the memory used by a map is proportional to the size of its keys and values.

#### No Extra Information: 
The use of struct{}{} clearly communicates that the keys themselves are important, and there is no need for associated values. It avoids the need to allocate and manage additional memory for boolean values.

#### No Unused Space: 
With boolean values, you might end up with some unused space associated with each key due to padding. The empty struct doesn't have this issue.

Here's a simple example to illustrate:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Using boolean values
    visitedBool := make(map[int]bool)
    visitedBool[42] = true

    // Using empty struct
    visitedStruct := make(map[int]struct{})
    visitedStruct[42] = struct{}{}

    fmt.Println("Size of visitedBool:", len(visitedBool))
    fmt.Println("Size of visitedStruct:", len(visitedStruct))
}
```
In this example, you can observe that the size of the map with boolean values is larger than the size of the map with empty structs, indicating less memory overhead. This becomes more significant when dealing with a large number of keys.

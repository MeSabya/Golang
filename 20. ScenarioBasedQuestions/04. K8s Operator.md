## 1. Testing Your Operator
- Scenario: Your team has developed an Operator and now needs to thoroughly test its functionality before deploying it in production.
- Question: How would you test the reconciliation logic, CRDs, and error handling in your Operator? What tools and techniques would you use to ensure your Operator is reliable?
- Follow-up: How would you perform load testing to ensure that the Operator can handle high volumes of CRs being created and deleted?
- Expected Concepts: Unit testing using kubebuilder’s testing framework, end-to-end tests using envtest or KinD (Kubernetes in Docker), mocking Kubernetes API interactions, handling edge cases, and testing with high concurrency and scale.

## 2.Handling Secrets and Sensitive Data
- Scenario: Your Operator manages applications that require sensitive data (e.g., API keys or passwords) stored in Kubernetes secrets. You need to ensure that these secrets are securely managed.
- Question: How would you design your Operator to securely handle secrets, ensuring that they are properly created, rotated, and securely mounted into the application?
- Follow-up: How would you handle secret updates and ensure that the application is restarted or reloaded when secrets are rotated?
- Expected Concepts: Kubernetes Secrets API, securely mounting secrets, secret rotation strategies, triggering pod restarts (e.g., annotations on secrets), and ensuring secure handling of sensitive data within the Operator.

## 3. Operator Upgrade Management
- Scenario: You have deployed an Operator in production, and now you need to upgrade it to support new CRD fields and manage existing resources during the upgrade.
- Question: How would you design your Operator to support upgrades, ensuring backward compatibility with older versions of the CRD and gracefully handling new fields?
- Follow-up: How would you manage the migration of existing Custom Resources (CRs) to support new fields?
- Expected Concepts: CRD versioning (v1beta1 to v1), OpenAPI schema validation, handling default values for new fields, CRD migrations, and backward compatibility considerations.

## 4. Implementing Custom Finalizers for Cleanup
- Scenario: Your Operator manages resources that require custom clean-up logic before deletion (e.g., deleting external cloud resources). You need to ensure that custom resources are cleaned up properly when they are deleted.
- Question: How would you implement custom finalizers in your Operator to handle the clean-up process, ensuring that external resources are deleted before the Kubernetes resource is removed?
- Follow-up: How would you handle cases where the external resource deletion fails, ensuring the system does not leave orphaned resources?
- Expected Concepts: Finalizers, reconciliation loop, CRD lifecycle, error handling for external resources, retries, and ensuring clean-up idempotency. 

## 5. Handling Operator Reconciliation Failures
- Scenario: Your Operator periodically reconciles the desired and actual state of a resource. However, certain resources (e.g., third-party APIs or cloud services) may fail intermittently.
- Question: How would you handle intermittent failures in your Operator’s reconciliation loop, ensuring that the system remains stable and self-healing?
- Follow-up: How would you handle permanent failures that require user intervention?
- Expected Concepts: Exponential backoff, retry mechanisms, logging, status conditions in CRDs to reflect failure states, error handling in the reconciliation loop, and user notifications or alerts.

## 6. Managing High Availability of the Operator Itself
- Scenario: Your Operator is critical to the functioning of the system and must be highly available (HA). You need to ensure that if one instance of the Operator fails, another can take over seamlessly.
- Question: How would you design your Operator to be highly available, ensuring that there is no single point of failure?
- Follow-up: How would you handle leader election between multiple instances of the Operator?
- Expected Concepts: Leader election (kubernetes/client-go/tools/leaderelection), multiple Operator replicas, handling failover, ensuring reconciliation is only performed by the leader, and designing stateless Operators for high availability.

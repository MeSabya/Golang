  ### 1. Use bytes.Buffer or strings.Builder:
  #### Example using strings.Builder: This is more efficient than bytes.buffer
  ```go
package main

import (
	"strings"
	"fmt"
)

func optimizeStringManipulation(input string) string {
	// Use strings.Builder to reduce allocations
	var builder strings.Builder
	builder.Grow(len(input)) // Preallocate memory to avoid resizing during append

	// Perform all operations in one loop
	for _, ch := range input {
		if ch != ' ' { // Trim whitespace
			// Convert to lowercase
			builder.WriteRune(strings.ToLower(string(ch))[0]) // Convert each character to lowercase
		}
	}

	// Replace substrings after basic processing, if needed
	result := strings.ReplaceAll(builder.String(), "old_substring", "new_substring")

	return result
}

func main() {
	input := "   Example String   "
	output := optimizeStringManipulation(input)
	fmt.Println(output) // example string
}
```
#### bytes.buffer example
```golang
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"fmt"
	"strings"
	"unicode"
)

func optimizeStringManipulation(input string) string {
	// Create a bytes.Buffer for efficient string building
	var buffer bytes.Buffer
	buffer.Grow(len(input)) // Preallocate enough space for the input length to avoid resizing

	// Iterate over the input and apply transformations
	for _, ch := range input {
		// Trim whitespace and convert to lowercase
		if !unicode.IsSpace(ch) {
			buffer.WriteRune(unicode.ToLower(ch)) // Write lowercase version of the character
		}
	}

	// Convert the buffer back to a string and perform a substring replacement if needed
	result := strings.ReplaceAll(buffer.String(), "old_substring", "new_substring")

	return result
}

func main() {
	input := "   Example String with old_substring   "
	output := optimizeStringManipulation(input)
	fmt.Println(output) // Output: "examplestringwithnew_substring"
}
```
### Use strings.Map for Character-Wise Operations:
When you need to process each character in a string (e.g., lowercasing or replacing), use strings.Map, which allows you to transform characters in a single pass. This reduces the need for intermediate allocations.

```golang
package main

import (
	"strings"
	"fmt"
	"unicode"
)

func optimizeStringManipulation(input string) string {
	// Trim whitespace, convert to lowercase, and process each character in one pass using strings.Map
	result := strings.Map(func(r rune) rune {
		if unicode.IsSpace(r) {
			return -1 // remove whitespace
		}
		return unicode.ToLower(r) // convert to lowercase
	}, input)

	// Replace substrings after basic processing
	result = strings.ReplaceAll(result, "old_substring", "new_substring")

	return result
}

func main() {
	input := "   Example String   "
	output := optimizeStringManipulation(input)
	fmt.Println(output) // example string
}
```

## 4. String Parsing
- Scenario: You receive a large CSV string as input, and you need to extract certain columns while ensuring the data is well-formed.

- Follow-up: What package would you use, and how would you implement error handling for corrupted input?
- Expected Concepts: encoding/csv package, handling string parsing edge cases, and strategies for dealing with malformed input.

- Follow-up: How would you handle cases where the dynamic data is missing or needs default values?
- Expected Concepts: fmt.Sprintf, text/template and html/template for dynamic string generation, handling missing values in templates, and localization concerns.

## 7. Immutable Strings and Byte Buffers
- Scenario: You need to build a large string by concatenating many smaller strings together (e.g., assembling HTML content). Given that strings in Go are immutable, you want to avoid creating many intermediate strings.
- Question: How would you implement string concatenation efficiently in Go? What approach would you take to minimize memory overhead and improve performance?

- Follow-up: How does Go compare strings internally? What happens in terms of performance when comparing large strings?
- Expected Concepts: strings.Compare, case-insensitive comparison (strings.EqualFold), lexicographic comparison, comparing strings as byte slices, and understanding Go’s internal string comparison mechanism.

## 10. Multithreaded String Processing
- Scenario: You are processing a large text file, and you want to speed up the processing by splitting the work across multiple goroutines. Each goroutine processes a portion of the file's content.
- Question: How would you split the work among multiple goroutines while ensuring safe string processing and proper synchronization?
- Follow-up: How do you ensure that goroutines don’t introduce race conditions or data corruption while processing strings?
- Expected Concepts: splitting large files into smaller parts, processing strings in parallel using goroutines, synchronization (e.g., using sync.WaitGroup or channels), and avoiding race conditions when working with shared resources.

	for scanner.Scan() {
		chunk = append(chunk, scanner.Text())
		if len(chunk) >= chunkSize {
			wg.Add(1)
			go processChunk(chunk, &wg, &mu, &results)
			chunk = []string{} // Clear chunk for the next set of lines
		}
	}

	// Process any remaining lines
	if len(chunk) > 0 {
		wg.Add(1)
		go processChunk(chunk, &wg, &mu, &results)
	}

	wg.Wait()

	// Output the results or further processing

## 12. Substring Search in Large Files
- Scenario: You are tasked with searching for a specific substring within a large file (several gigabytes). The file cannot be loaded fully into memory.
- Question: How would you efficiently search for a substring in such a large file using Go?
- Follow-up: How would your approach differ if you were searching for multiple substrings simultaneously?
- Expected Concepts: reading files in chunks (bufio.Scanner, os.File.Read), streaming search, strings.Contains or bytes.Contains, and memory-efficient handling of large files.

<details>

Searching for a single substring

Concepts to use:

Read the file in chunks to avoid loading the whole file into memory.

Use bytes.Contains for binary-safe substring search.

Handle the edge case where the substring could be split across two chunks.

Implementation idea (Go):

```go
package main

import (
    "bytes"
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func searchSingleSubstring(filePath string, substr []byte) (bool, error) {
    const chunkSize = 4096 // or larger, e.g., 64KB
    file, err := os.Open(filePath)
    if err != nil {
        return false, err
    }
    defer file.Close()

    buf := make([]byte, chunkSize)
    var leftover []byte

    for {
        n, err := file.Read(buf)
        if n == 0 {
            break
        }
        chunk := append(leftover, buf[:n]...) // prepend leftover from previous read

        if bytes.Contains(chunk, substr) {
            return true, nil
        }

        // save last len(substr)-1 bytes to handle boundary match
        if len(substr)-1 < len(chunk) {
            leftover = chunk[len(chunk)-len(substr)+1:]
        } else {
            leftover = chunk
        }

        if err != nil {
            if err == os.EOF {
                break
            }
            return false, err
        }
    }

    return false, nil
}

func main() {
    found, err := searchSingleSubstring("largefile.txt", []byte("target"))
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    } else if found {
        fmt.Println("Substring found!")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Substring not found.")
    }
}
```

Key points:

- Reading in chunks ensures memory efficiency.
- Leftover bytes are used to catch substrings split across two chunks.
- bytes.Contains is preferred for binary-safe search.

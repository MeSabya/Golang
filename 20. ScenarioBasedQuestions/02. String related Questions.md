## 1. String Manipulation and Optimization
- Scenario: You have a large string in Go, and you need to perform multiple operations like trimming whitespace, converting to lowercase, and replacing certain substrings.
- Question: How would you optimize string manipulation in Go to avoid unnecessary allocations and copying?
- Follow-up: What are the performance implications of using strings vs. byte slices when manipulating large amounts of text data?
- Expected Concepts: strings package (e.g., Trim, ToLower, Replace), working with byte slices ([]byte), and avoiding excessive allocations by minimizing string copies.

## 2. Unicode and String Encoding
- Scenario: You are processing user input in various languages and need to ensure that your application correctly handles Unicode characters (e.g., emojis, non-Latin scripts).
- Question: How does Go handle Unicode in strings? How would you ensure that string manipulation (like slicing or indexing) doesn't break when dealing with multi-byte characters?
- Follow-up: How can you iterate over runes (Unicode code points) in a string in Go?
- Expected Concepts: UTF-8 encoding, handling runes (rune type), and using for range to iterate over runes in a string.

## 3. String Search and Matching
- Scenario: You need to search for specific patterns within a large text file, such as finding all lines that contain a certain word or regex pattern.
- Question: How would you implement a solution to search for a substring or regex pattern in Go? What is the most efficient way to search through large strings?
- Follow-up: How would you handle cases where the pattern to search is a regular expression?
- Expected Concepts: strings.Contains, strings.Index, regexp package for regular expressions, and efficient string search algorithms for large text data.

## 4. String Parsing
- Scenario: You receive a large CSV string as input, and you need to extract certain columns while ensuring the data is well-formed.
- Question: How would you parse this CSV string efficiently in Go? How would you handle cases where the input data is malformed or contains edge cases, like commas within quotes?
- Follow-up: What package would you use, and how would you implement error handling for corrupted input?
- Expected Concepts: encoding/csv package, handling string parsing edge cases, and strategies for dealing with malformed input.

## 5. Splitting and Joining Strings
- Scenario: You are given a large, delimited string (e.g., comma-separated values), and you need to split it into individual components and then rejoin those components after processing.
- Question: How would you split and join strings efficiently in Go? What are the edge cases you would need to consider, such as empty fields or extra spaces?
- Follow-up: What are the performance considerations when splitting and joining large strings?
- Expected Concepts: strings.Split, strings.Join, performance considerations with splitting large strings, handling empty fields, and trimming unwanted whitespace.

## 6. String Interpolation/Formatting
- Scenario: You need to build a formatted output string that includes dynamic values like dates, numbers, and text. This string will be used in a user-facing report.
- Question: How would you efficiently format a string in Go, ensuring that the formatting is consistent and locale-aware?
- Follow-up: How would you handle cases where the dynamic data is missing or needs default values?
- Expected Concepts: fmt.Sprintf, text/template and html/template for dynamic string generation, handling missing values in templates, and localization concerns.

## 7. Immutable Strings and Byte Buffers
- Scenario: You need to build a large string by concatenating many smaller strings together (e.g., assembling HTML content). Given that strings in Go are immutable, you want to avoid creating many intermediate strings.
- Question: How would you implement string concatenation efficiently in Go? What approach would you take to minimize memory overhead and improve performance?
- Follow-up: How does using bytes.Buffer or strings.Builder help in this case?
- Expected Concepts: immutability of strings, using strings.Builder or bytes.Buffer for efficient string concatenation, and performance implications of string concatenation in a loop.

## 8. Validating and Sanitizing User Input
- Scenario: You are developing a web form where users can submit their names and comments. You need to sanitize the input to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or XSS (cross-site scripting).
- Question: How would you validate and sanitize user input in Go to ensure it is safe for storage and display?
- Follow-up: What libraries or techniques would you use to sanitize and escape potentially harmful input?
- Expected Concepts: validating user input (e.g., length, characters), sanitizing/escaping for SQL (database/sql), sanitizing for HTML (html/template), and preventing common security vulnerabilities.

## 9. Efficient String Comparison
- Scenario: You are working with a large dataset containing many strings, and you need to compare them efficiently (e.g., for sorting or matching purposes).
- Question: How would you efficiently compare two strings in Go, especially when the dataset is large? Are there faster alternatives for certain types of string comparisons (e.g., case-insensitive)?
- Follow-up: How does Go compare strings internally? What happens in terms of performance when comparing large strings?
- Expected Concepts: strings.Compare, case-insensitive comparison (strings.EqualFold), lexicographic comparison, comparing strings as byte slices, and understanding Go’s internal string comparison mechanism.

## 10. Multithreaded String Processing
- Scenario: You are processing a large text file, and you want to speed up the processing by splitting the work across multiple goroutines. Each goroutine processes a portion of the file's content.
- Question: How would you split the work among multiple goroutines while ensuring safe string processing and proper synchronization?
- Follow-up: How do you ensure that goroutines don’t introduce race conditions or data corruption while processing strings?
- Expected Concepts: splitting large files into smaller parts, processing strings in parallel using goroutines, synchronization (e.g., using sync.WaitGroup or channels), and avoiding race conditions when working with shared resources.

## 11. String Deduplication and Compression
- Scenario: You have a large collection of strings that contains a lot of duplicate entries. You want to remove duplicates and store the unique strings in an efficient way.
- Question: How would you implement string deduplication in Go? What data structures would you use to store the unique strings efficiently?
- Follow-up: How would you handle very large datasets that cannot fit into memory?
- Expected Concepts: using map[string]struct{} or sync.Map for deduplication, efficient handling of large datasets (e.g., streaming data processing), and possible strategies for compression (e.g., using gzip for large text datasets).

## 12. Substring Search in Large Files
- Scenario: You are tasked with searching for a specific substring within a large file (several gigabytes). The file cannot be loaded fully into memory.
- Question: How would you efficiently search for a substring in such a large file using Go?
- Follow-up: How would your approach differ if you were searching for multiple substrings simultaneously?
- Expected Concepts: reading files in chunks (bufio.Scanner, os.File.Read), streaming search, strings.Contains or bytes.Contains, and memory-efficient handling of large files.

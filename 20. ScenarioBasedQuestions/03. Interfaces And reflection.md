## 1. Interface for Dependency Injection
Scenario: You’re building a service that interacts with a third-party API. To write unit tests, you want to mock the API, so your tests don’t rely on live network calls.
Question: How would you design your service using interfaces so that you can easily mock the third-party API during testing? Can you demonstrate how dependency injection would work in this case?
Follow-up: What are the trade-offs of using interfaces for every external dependency?
Expected Concepts: interface abstraction, dependency injection, mocking for tests, using interface types to decouple implementation from the interface, trade-offs in terms of flexibility vs. complexity.

## 2. Empty Interface and Type Assertions
Scenario: You are developing a function that needs to work with multiple types of inputs (e.g., int, float64, string). You decide to use the empty interface (interface{}) to allow for flexibility.
Question: How would you use type assertions or type switches to handle the different types in Go? Can you provide a code example to demonstrate how you would handle these types dynamically?
Follow-up: What are the performance considerations when using the empty interface and type assertions?
Expected Concepts: interface{}, type assertions, type switches, handling dynamic types, performance impact of using the empty interface, and when to avoid it.

## 3. Dynamic Method Invocation using Reflection
Scenario: You have a struct with multiple methods, and at runtime, you want to dynamically call methods based on the method name (which is passed as a string).
Question: How would you use reflection to dynamically invoke a method by its name on a struct in Go?
Follow-up: What are the limitations and potential issues of using reflection for method invocation in Go?
Expected Concepts: reflect.Value, reflect.Method, calling methods dynamically, handling method signatures (with arguments and return values), limitations of reflection (e.g., lack of compile-time safety, performance costs).

## 4. Validating Structs Using Reflection
- Scenario: You are writing a validation library that should check if all required fields in a struct are populated (e.g., fields marked with a required tag). The struct fields are unknown at compile time.
- Question: How would you use reflection to iterate over struct fields and check if the required fields are populated?
- Follow-up: What are the trade-offs of using reflection for validation compared to using a code-generation approach?
- Expected Concepts: reflect.Type, reflect.Value, reading struct field tags, iterating over struct fields, comparing reflection vs. code generation (e.g., using go generate).

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

To design a file-processing library that adheres to the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), you should avoid creating large, monolithic interfaces that force all file types (e.g., images, PDFs, text) to implement methods they don't need. Instead, define small, focused interfaces that capture specific behaviors relevant to each file type.

### Design Approach:
- Split Interfaces by Responsibility: Each file type (e.g., images, PDFs, text) has its own specific set of operations. You should define separate interfaces for different behaviors, like resizing, parsing, or reading, so that only the necessary operations are exposed for each file type.

- Compose Interfaces: You can compose smaller interfaces when needed, allowing more complex types to implement multiple interfaces. For example, an image may need resizing and reading, while a PDF may only need parsing.

```go
// FileReader defines an interface for reading file contents
type FileReader interface {
    Read() ([]byte, error)
}

// ImageResizer defines an interface for resizing images
type ImageResizer interface {
    Resize(width int, height int) error
}

// PDFParser defines an interface for parsing PDFs
type PDFParser interface {
    Parse() (string, error)
}

// TextProcessor defines an interface for processing text files
type TextProcessor interface {
    ProcessText() (string, error)
}

// ImageFile struct implements FileReader and ImageResizer
type ImageFile struct {
    Path string
}

func (img *ImageFile) Read() ([]byte, error) {
    // Logic to read image file
    return []byte("image data"), nil
}

func (img *ImageFile) Resize(width int, height int) error {
    // Logic to resize image
    fmt.Printf("Resizing image to %dx%d\n", width, height)
    return nil
}

// PDFFile struct implements FileReader and PDFParser
type PDFFile struct {
    Path string
}

func (pdf *PDFFile) Read() ([]byte, error) {
    // Logic to read PDF file
    return []byte("pdf data"), nil
}

func (pdf *PDFFile) Parse() (string, error) {
    // Logic to parse PDF contents
    return "parsed PDF content", nil
}

// TextFile struct implements FileReader and TextProcessor
type TextFile struct {
    Path string
}

func (txt *TextFile) Read() ([]byte, error) {
    // Logic to read text file
    return []byte("text data"), nil
}

func (txt *TextFile) ProcessText() (string, error) {
    // Logic to process text
    return "processed text", nil
}

func main() {
    image := &ImageFile{Path: "image.png"}
    pdf := &PDFFile{Path: "document.pdf"}
    text := &TextFile{Path: "file.txt"}

    // Reading and resizing an image
    imgData, _ := image.Read()
    fmt.Println("Image data:", string(imgData))
    image.Resize(800, 600)

    // Reading and parsing a PDF
    pdfData, _ := pdf.Read()
    fmt.Println("PDF data:", string(pdfData))
    parsedContent, _ := pdf.Parse()
    fmt.Println("Parsed PDF:", parsedContent)

    // Reading and processing a text file
    txtData, _ := text.Read()
    fmt.Println("Text data:", string(txtData))
    processedText, _ := text.ProcessText()
    fmt.Println("Processed text:", processedText)
}
```

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# FileReader interface for reading file content
class FileReader(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def read(self):
        pass

# ImageResizer interface for resizing images
class ImageResizer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def resize(self, width: int, height: int):
        pass

# PDFParser interface for parsing PDFs
class PDFParser(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def parse(self) -> str:
        pass

# TextProcessor interface for processing text files
class TextProcessor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process_text(self) -> str:
        pass
```

## 8. Dynamic Struct Field Access Using Reflection
Scenario: You need to build a function that takes a struct and a field name as a string, and returns the value of that field. The struct can be of any type, and the field name is provided at runtime.
Question: How would you use reflection to access a struct’s field by its name dynamically? Can you show an example of how to implement this?
Follow-up: How would you handle cases where the field name does not exist in the struct?
Expected Concepts: reflect.Value.FieldByName, checking for field existence, handling invalid field names, and returning errors or zero values gracefully.

## 9. Dynamic Type Creation Using Reflection
Scenario: You are working on a system where you need to dynamically create instances of types based on input data at runtime. For example, given a string that represents a type name, you want to create an instance of that type.
Question: How would you use reflection to create new instances of a type dynamically in Go?
Follow-up: What are the challenges associated with dynamic type creation, and how would you manage them?
Expected Concepts: reflect.New, working with dynamic types, managing the lifecycle of dynamically created types, handling type safety at runtime, and dealing with memory and initialization concerns.

## 10. Interface Conformance at Runtime
Scenario: You have multiple types in your application, and you want to check at runtime whether a particular type satisfies a specific interface (without knowing the type beforehand).
Question: How would you check at runtime if a type implements an interface in Go? Can you provide an example where you might use this technique?
Follow-up: What are the differences between compile-time interface checking and runtime interface checking in Go?
Expected Concepts: using type assertions for interface checking, ok idiom (if obj, ok := someVar.(SomeInterface); ok), differences between runtime and compile-time interface checks, and when runtime interface checking is useful.

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  ```golang
  func PrintDescription(d Describer) {
    fmt.Println(d.Describe())  // Compile-time check ensures 'd' implements Describer
}

p := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 25}
PrintDescription(p)  // No need for runtime check; compiler guarantees correctness
```

Checked at Runtime: Using type assertions or type switches, you can check whether a type implements an interface dynamically. This is useful in situations where the type is not known at compile-time.
Flexible but Slower: Runtime checks allow for more dynamic behavior but come with some performance cost due to the overhead of reflection and type assertion.

## 11. Reflection for Object Serialization
Scenario: You are developing a custom serialization library that converts any Go struct into a specific string format (e.g., JSON-like or custom encoding). You don’t know the struct type at compile-time.
Question: How would you use reflection to serialize the fields of a struct dynamically? What challenges might you face when serializing nested structs or handling pointer types?
Follow-up: How would you deal with unexported fields, and what are the best practices for using reflection in such cases?
Expected Concepts: iterating over struct fields, handling nested structs and pointer types, accessing exported and unexported fields, and pitfalls of using reflection for serialization.

## 12. Designing Interface-based Plugins
Scenario: You are tasked with designing a plugin system where developers can add their own modules to extend the functionality of your application. The plugins should implement predefined behavior using interfaces.
Question: How would you design the plugin system using Go interfaces, allowing developers to write their own modules and dynamically load them into your application?
Follow-up: How would you manage compatibility between different plugin versions and your main application?
Expected Concepts: using interfaces for plugin extensibility, dynamic module loading (with plugin package or manual interface implementations), versioning concerns, and managing backward compatibility with plugins.

## 13. Implementing Interface with Multiple Return Types
Scenario: You’re developing a data processing pipeline that reads data from multiple sources (e.g., files, databases, APIs). Each source has a different return type (e.g., string, struct, JSON).
Question: How would you design an interface that can accommodate these different return types? How would you handle cases where the return type is unknown at compile time?
Follow-up: Can you demonstrate a flexible approach for handling different types while keeping the interface simple?
Expected Concepts: using interface{} to handle multiple return types, type assertions for return types, and balancing flexibility with simplicity in interface design.

## 14. Reflection for Unit Testing Private Methods
Scenario: You need to write unit tests for a Go package that contains private methods or fields that are not directly accessible outside the package. However, you want to test their behavior without changing the package's visibility rules.
Question: How would you use reflection to test private methods or access private fields in Go?
Follow-up: What are the pros and cons of using reflection to access private fields/methods during testing?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

In Go, you can't directly access private (unexported) methods or fields from outside a package due to the language's strict visibility rules. However, reflection can be used to bypass these restrictions and allow testing of unexported fields or methods.

Accessing Private Fields/Methods via Reflection
You can use Go’s reflect package to access unexported fields or call unexported methods during testing. Here's how you would approach this:

### Example Scenario:
Assume you have a package mypackage with a private struct myStruct and an unexported method calculate() that you want to test.

```golang
// mypackage/myfile.go
package mypackage

type myStruct struct {
    value int
}

// unexported method
func (m *myStruct) calculate() int {
    return m.value * 2
}

// mypackage/myfile_test.go
package mypackage

import (
    "reflect"
    "testing"
)

func TestCalculate(t *testing.T) {
    // Create an instance of myStruct
    m := &myStruct{value: 5}

    // Get the reflect.Value of the method by name (even though it's unexported)
    method := reflect.ValueOf(m).MethodByName("calculate")
    if !method.IsValid() {
        t.Fatalf("Method 'calculate' not found")
    }

    // Call the method using reflection
    result := method.Call(nil) // nil because calculate() takes no arguments

    // Check the result
    expected := 10
    if result[0].Int() != int64(expected) {
        t.Errorf("Expected %d but got %d", expected, result[0].Int())
    }
}

func TestAccessPrivateField(t *testing.T) {
    // Create an instance of myStruct
    m := &myStruct{value: 5}

    // Get reflect.Value of the struct
    v := reflect.ValueOf(m).Elem() // Use Elem() to get the value from the pointer

    // Access the unexported field
    field := v.FieldByName("value")
    if !field.IsValid() {
        t.Fatalf("Field 'value' not found")
    }

    // Modify the field value (make it writable)
    field.SetInt(10)

    // Check if the value is updated
    if m.value != 10 {
        t.Errorf("Expected value to be 10 but got %d", m.value)
    }
}
```

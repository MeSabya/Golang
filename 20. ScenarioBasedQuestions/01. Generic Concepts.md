## 1. Concurrency Handling

- Scenario: You have a web service that handles multiple requests concurrently. Each request must access shared data safely without causing race conditions.
- Question: How would you handle concurrency in this situation? What strategies can you employ to avoid race conditions in Go?
- Follow-up: What are the differences between using sync.Mutex and Go’s channels to handle concurrency, and when would you use each?
- Expected Concepts: goroutines, mutexes, channels, race conditions, sync package, design patterns for concurrent programming in Go.

## 2. Graceful Shutdown
- Scenario: You have a Go application running several goroutines handling background jobs. When a shutdown signal is received, you want to gracefully stop the goroutines, allowing them to complete current work before exiting.
- Question: How would you implement graceful shutdown for your Go application? Can you walk through a potential implementation?
- Follow-up: How would you handle cancellation and ensure goroutines are not stuck indefinitely?
- Expected Concepts: context cancellation (context.Context), signaling (using os.Signal), sync.WaitGroup, and clean shutdown strategies.

## 3. Memory Management and Goroutines
- Scenario: Your Go application is leaking memory under heavy load. After investigating, you notice that some long-running goroutines never complete.
- Question: What could be causing the memory leak? How would you troubleshoot and fix it?
- Follow-up: How can you prevent goroutine leaks in the future?
- Expected Concepts: goroutine leaks, memory profiling (pprof), managing lifecycle of goroutines, ensuring proper channel closure, and exit conditions.

## 4. Error Handling in APIs
- Scenario: You’re building an API that interacts with several external services. If one of the services fails, your API should return a meaningful error message to the client without exposing internal implementation details.
- Question: How do you structure error handling in your API? Can you explain how you would implement proper error wrapping and logging?
- Follow-up: How does Go’s errors.Is, errors.As, and fmt.Errorf("%w") help with error handling?
- Expected Concepts: error handling best practices, error wrapping, Go 1.13+ error features (errors.Is, errors.As, errors.Unwrap), creating custom error types, and logging patterns.

## 5. Data Streaming and Channels
- Scenario: You need to process a continuous stream of data (e.g., sensor readings) in Go. The data should be processed by multiple worker goroutines to parallelize the workload.
- Question: How would you design a worker pool using Go’s channels and goroutines to handle this stream of data?
- Follow-up: How would you handle backpressure if the producers are generating data faster than your workers can process?
- Expected Concepts: goroutines, channels, worker pools, backpressure handling, and bounded channels.

## 6. Performance Optimization
- Scenario: Your Go application has a function that is consuming a significant amount of CPU. You need to optimize it without changing its behavior.
- Question: How would you approach performance optimization in Go? What tools or techniques would you use to identify bottlenecks?
- Follow-up: Can you describe how the Go runtime handles memory management (e.g., garbage collection) and how it can impact performance?
- Expected Concepts: profiling tools (pprof, go tool trace), CPU and memory profiling, understanding Go's garbage collector, optimizations like avoiding unnecessary memory allocations, and improving algorithmic complexity.

## 7. Database Transactions
- Scenario: You are building a transactional system that interacts with a SQL database. Multiple queries need to run as part of a single transaction, and if one query fails, the entire transaction should be rolled back.
- Question: How would you implement this in Go, ensuring proper error handling and resource cleanup?
- Follow-up: What happens if the application panics during a transaction? How can you ensure that resources like database connections are always cleaned up?
- Expected Concepts: SQL transactions in Go (database/sql), using defer for resource cleanup, handling rollbacks and commits, and panic recovery.

## 8. Handling HTTP Timeouts
- Scenario: You have an HTTP client in Go that makes requests to external APIs. Occasionally, the APIs take too long to respond, and you want to avoid waiting indefinitely.
- Question: How would you implement timeouts and retries for HTTP requests in Go? How do you ensure your code doesn’t block forever?
- Follow-up: How does Go’s context.Context help in handling request timeouts?
- Expected Concepts: http.Client timeouts, context.Context, retries with exponential backoff, and proper error handling for network-related failures.

## 9. Interfacing and Dependency Injection
- Scenario: You’re developing a module that depends on external services. For unit testing, you want to mock these external dependencies to avoid actual network calls.
- Question: How would you design your Go code to allow for easy mocking and testing of external services?
- Follow-up: How would you use Go interfaces to implement dependency injection?
- Expected Concepts: Go interfaces, mocking, dependency injection patterns, and unit testing (testing package and mocking tools like gomock).

## 10. Data Race in Goroutines
- Scenario: You’re asked to implement a function that spawns multiple goroutines to update a shared counter. You notice that sometimes the result is incorrect due to race conditions.
- Question: How would you fix the data race in this scenario? Can you demonstrate different ways to synchronize access to the shared counter?
- Follow-up: How does Go's race detector (go run -race) help in identifying such issues?
- Expected Concepts: race conditions, sync.Mutex, sync.Atomic, the Go race detector, and how to prevent data races in concurrent programming.

## 11. Rate Limiting
- Scenario: You are building an API server that needs to limit the number of requests it can handle from a single user to prevent abuse.
- Question: How would you implement rate limiting in Go? What tools or patterns would you use to ensure fairness and scalability?
- Follow-up: Can you explain the differences between token bucket and leaky bucket algorithms for rate limiting?
- Expected Concepts: rate limiting strategies, implementing rate limiters using Go's time.Ticker and context.Context, token bucket vs leaky bucket, and distributed rate limiting considerations.

## 12. JSON Marshaling and Unmarshaling
- Scenario: You need to interact with an external REST API that returns a complex nested JSON structure. Your Go application needs to unmarshal this JSON response into appropriate Go structs.
- Question: How would you structure your Go code to unmarshal this JSON? What are the common pitfalls you might encounter with JSON marshaling/unmarshaling in Go?
- Follow-up: How would you handle optional or missing fields in the JSON response?
- Expected Concepts: JSON marshaling/unmarshaling (encoding/json), struct tags, handling optional fields, and custom marshaling/unmarshaling logic.

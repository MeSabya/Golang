## 1. Concurrency Handling

- Scenario: You have a web service that handles multiple requests concurrently. Each request must access shared data safely without causing race conditions.
- Question: How would you handle concurrency in this situation? What strategies can you employ to avoid race conditions in Go?
- Follow-up: What are the differences between using sync.Mutex and Go’s channels to handle concurrency, and when would you use each?
- Expected Concepts: goroutines, mutexes, channels, race conditions, sync package, design patterns for concurrent programming in Go.

## 2. Graceful Shutdown or for-select-done idiom
- Scenario: You have a Go application running several goroutines handling background jobs. When a shutdown signal is received, you want to gracefully stop the goroutines, allowing them to complete current work before exiting.
- Question: How would you implement graceful shutdown for your Go application? Can you walk through a potential implementation?
- Follow-up: How would you handle cancellation and ensure goroutines are not stuck indefinitely?
- Expected Concepts: context cancellation (context.Context), signaling (using os.Signal), sync.WaitGroup, and clean shutdown strategies.

  ```go
  // MessageChannel returns a receive only channel and starts a goroutine
// which sends message to that channel after every 2 seconds.
func MessageChannel() <-chan string {
	ch := make(chan string)
	go func() {
		defer close(ch)
		for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
			time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
			ch <- fmt.Sprintf("message %d", i)
		}
	}()
	return ch
}

// NotificationChannel returns a send only channel and starts
// a goroutine which receives notifications from that channel.
func NotificationChannel() chan<- string {
	ch := make(chan string)
	go func() {
		for _ = range ch {
			// do nothing
		}
	}()
	return ch
}

func main() {
	source := MessageChannel()
	destination := NotificationChannel()

	done := make(chan struct{})
  // worker goroutine
	go func() {
		defer close(done)
		for {
			message, ok := <-source
			if !ok {
				return
			}
			fmt.Printf("message received: %s\n", message)
			// some processing
			fmt.Println("processing...")
			time.Sleep(time.Second)
			notification := fmt.Sprintf("notification - %s", message)
			destination <- notification
			fmt.Println("notification sent")
		}
	}()
	<-done
}
```

Go applications may be abruptly terminated by triggers such as container stop/restart when using docker, pressing Ctrl+C or closing the terminal.

Let’s press Ctrl+C while our application is processing the received message. It abruptly terminates the execution and the message is lost -

```shell
message received: message 0
processing...
notification sent
message received: message 1
processing...
exit status 0xc000013a
```

The above output shows that notification for message 0 was sent to destination but notification for message 1 is lost due to premature termination during processing.

How can we ensure that the notification for any received message is not lost and always gets delivered to the destination?
Let’s write solution to this problem.

```go
func main() {
	source := MessageChannel()
	destination := NotificationChannel()

	ctx, cancel := signal.NotifyContext(context.Background(), os.Interrupt)
	done := make(chan struct{})
	go func() {
		defer close(done)
		for {
			select {
			case <-ctx.Done():
				return
			case message, ok := <-source:
				if !ok {
					return
				}
				fmt.Printf("message received: %s\n", message)
				// some processing
				fmt.Println("processing...")
				time.Sleep(time.Second)
				notification := fmt.Sprintf("notification - %s", message)
				destination <- notification
				fmt.Println("notification sent")
			}
		}
	}()
	<-done
	cancel() // release context resources
	fmt.Printf("main exits")
}
```

### Some more questions around this solution 
#### Question
```shell
If   !ok {
            return
        } 

Still done is expecting something ..is this case of goroutine leak ?
```
Channel Read with ok:

When you read from a channel in Go with message, ok := <-source, the ok variable indicates whether the channel is still open (true) or closed (false).
If ok is false, it means the channel has been closed and all values have been received.
Goroutine Exits on Channel Close:

The statement if !ok { return } means that if the source channel is closed (ok is false), the worker goroutine will exit the for loop and return, effectively terminating the goroutine.
Channel Closure and done

Closing the done Channel:
The done channel is closed by the defer close(done) statement, which is guaranteed to be executed when the worker goroutine returns.
This ensures that once the worker goroutine exits (either because the source channel is closed or due to other conditions), the done channel will be closed, signaling the completion of the goroutine.

## 3. Memory Management and Goroutines
- Scenario: Your Go application is leaking memory under heavy load. After investigating, you notice that some long-running goroutines never complete.
- Question: What could be causing the memory leak? How would you troubleshoot and fix it?
- Follow-up: How can you prevent goroutine leaks in the future?
- Expected Concepts: goroutine leaks, memory profiling (pprof), managing lifecycle of goroutines, ensuring proper channel closure, and exit conditions.

## 4. Error Handling in APIs
- Scenario: You’re building an API that interacts with several external services. If one of the services fails, your API should return a meaningful error message to the client without exposing internal implementation details.
- Question: How do you structure error handling in your API? Can you explain how you would implement proper error wrapping and logging?
- Follow-up: How does Go’s errors.Is, errors.As, and fmt.Errorf("%w") help with error handling?
- Expected Concepts: error handling best practices, error wrapping, Go 1.13+ error features (errors.Is, errors.As, errors.Unwrap), creating custom error types, and logging patterns.

## 5. Data Streaming and Channels
- Scenario: You need to process a continuous stream of data (e.g., sensor readings) in Go. The data should be processed by multiple worker goroutines to parallelize the workload.
- Question: How would you design a worker pool using Go’s channels and goroutines to handle this stream of data?
- Follow-up: How would you handle backpressure if the producers are generating data faster than your workers can process?
- Expected Concepts: goroutines, channels, worker pools, backpressure handling, and bounded channels.

## 6. Performance Optimization
- Scenario: Your Go application has a function that is consuming a significant amount of CPU. You need to optimize it without changing its behavior.
- Question: How would you approach performance optimization in Go? What tools or techniques would you use to identify bottlenecks?
- Follow-up: Can you describe how the Go runtime handles memory management (e.g., garbage collection) and how it can impact performance?
- Expected Concepts: profiling tools (pprof, go tool trace), CPU and memory profiling, understanding Go's garbage collector, optimizations like avoiding unnecessary memory allocations, and improving algorithmic complexity.

## 7. Database Transactions
- Scenario: You are building a transactional system that interacts with a SQL database. Multiple queries need to run as part of a single transaction, and if one query fails, the entire transaction should be rolled back.
- Question: How would you implement this in Go, ensuring proper error handling and resource cleanup?
- Follow-up: What happens if the application panics during a transaction? How can you ensure that resources like database connections are always cleaned up?
- Expected Concepts: SQL transactions in Go (database/sql), using defer for resource cleanup, handling rollbacks and commits, and panic recovery.

## 8. Handling HTTP Timeouts
- Scenario: You have an HTTP client in Go that makes requests to external APIs. Occasionally, the APIs take too long to respond, and you want to avoid waiting indefinitely.
- Question: How would you implement timeouts and retries for HTTP requests in Go? How do you ensure your code doesn’t block forever?
- Follow-up: How does Go’s context.Context help in handling request timeouts?
- Expected Concepts: http.Client timeouts, context.Context, retries with exponential backoff, and proper error handling for network-related failures.

## 9. Interfacing and Dependency Injection
- Scenario: You’re developing a module that depends on external services. For unit testing, you want to mock these external dependencies to avoid actual network calls.
- Question: How would you design your Go code to allow for easy mocking and testing of external services?
- Follow-up: How would you use Go interfaces to implement dependency injection?
- Expected Concepts: Go interfaces, mocking, dependency injection patterns, and unit testing (testing package and mocking tools like gomock).

## 10. Data Race in Goroutines
- Scenario: You’re asked to implement a function that spawns multiple goroutines to update a shared counter. You notice that sometimes the result is incorrect due to race conditions.
- Question: How would you fix the data race in this scenario? Can you demonstrate different ways to synchronize access to the shared counter?
- Follow-up: How does Go's race detector (go run -race) help in identifying such issues?
- Expected Concepts: race conditions, sync.Mutex, sync.Atomic, the Go race detector, and how to prevent data races in concurrent programming.

## 11. Rate Limiting
- Scenario: You are building an API server that needs to limit the number of requests it can handle from a single user to prevent abuse.
- Question: How would you implement rate limiting in Go? What tools or patterns would you use to ensure fairness and scalability?
- Follow-up: Can you explain the differences between token bucket and leaky bucket algorithms for rate limiting?
- Expected Concepts: rate limiting strategies, implementing rate limiters using Go's time.Ticker and context.Context, token bucket vs leaky bucket, and distributed rate limiting considerations.

## 12. JSON Marshaling and Unmarshaling
- Scenario: You need to interact with an external REST API that returns a complex nested JSON structure. Your Go application needs to unmarshal this JSON response into appropriate Go structs.
- Question: How would you structure your Go code to unmarshal this JSON? What are the common pitfalls you might encounter with JSON marshaling/unmarshaling in Go?
- Follow-up: How would you handle optional or missing fields in the JSON response?
- Expected Concepts: JSON marshaling/unmarshaling (encoding/json), struct tags, handling optional fields, and custom marshaling/unmarshaling logic.

### Purpose of strings.NewReader(jsonStream)

#### Creates an io.Reader
strings.NewReader converts a string into an io.Reader, allowing it to be read like a file or network stream.
This is useful because many Go functions expect an io.Reader instead of a raw string.

#### Works with json.Decoder
The json.Decoder requires an io.Reader to read JSON incrementally.
json.NewDecoder(reader) allows streaming and decoding large JSON objects efficiently.

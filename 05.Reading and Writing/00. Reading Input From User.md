In Golang, bufio is a package used for buffered IO. Buffering IO is a technique used to temporarily accumulate the results for an IO operation before transmitting it forward. This technique can increase the speed of a program by reducing the number of system calls, 
which are typically slow operations. In this shot, we will look at some of the abstractions bufio provides for writing and reading operations.

### Writing with bufio


With bufio, we can use the bufio.Writer method to accumulate data into a buffer before writing to IO. In the example below, we have demonstrated three likely situations that you may encounter:

- The buffer is full
- The buffer has space after a write
- write larger than buffer capacity is made

#### 1. The buffer is full
As soon as the buffer is full, the write operation takes place.

#### 2. The buffer has space after write
If the buffer still has space after the last write, it will not attempt to complete that write until specifically urged to do so by the Flush() method.

#### 3. A write larger than buffer capacity is made
If a write is larger than buffer capacity,​ the buffer is skipped because there is no need to buffer.

```golang
package main
import (
  "fmt"
	"bufio"
)

// Writer type used to initialize buffer writer
type Writer int

func (*Writer) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
    fmt.Printf("Writing: %s\n",p)
    return len(p), nil
}

func main() {
  // declare a buffered writer 
  // with buffer size 4
  w := new(Writer)
  bw := bufio.NewWriterSize(w, 4)

  // Case 1: Writing to buffer until full
	bw.Write([]byte{'1'})
	bw.Write([]byte{'2'})
	bw.Write([]byte{'3'})
  bw.Write([]byte{'4'}) // write - buffer is full

  // Case 2: Buffer has space
  bw.Write([]byte{'5'})
	err := bw.Flush() // forcefully write remaining
	if err != nil {
    panic(err)
	}

  // Case 3: (too) large write for buffer 
  // Will skip buffer and write directly
  bw.Write([]byte("12345"))
}
```
### Reading with bufio

bufio allows us to read in batches with bufio.Reader. After a read, data is released, as required, from the buffer to the consumer. In the example below, we will look at:

- Peek
- ReadSlice
- ReadLine
- ReadByte
- Scanner

#### 1. Peek
The Peek method lets us see the first 
n bytes (referred to as peek value) in the buffer without consuming them. The method operates in the following way.

- If the peek value is less than buffer capacity, the characters equal to the peek value are returned.
- If the peek value is greater than buffer capacity, bufio.ErrBufferFull is returned.
- If the peek value includes EOF and is less than buffer capacity, EOF is returned.

#### 2. ReadSlice
ReadSlice has a signature of:

```golang
func (b *Reader) ReadSlice(delim byte) (line []byte, err error)
```
It returns a slice of the string including the delimiter. 
If the delimiter cannot be found, and EOF has been reached, then io.EOF is returned. If the delimiter is not reached and readSlice has exceeded buffer capacity, then io.ErrBufferFull is returned.

#### 3. ReadLine
ReadLine is defined as:

ReadLine() (line []byte, isPrefix bool, err error)

ReadLine uses ReadSlice under the hood. However, it removes new-line characters (\n or \r\n) from the returned slice.

Note that its signature is different because it returns the isPrefix flag as well. This flag returns true when the delimiter has not been found and the internal buffer is full.

Readline does not handle lines longer than the internal buffer. We can call it multiple times to finish reading.

#### 4. ReadByte
ReadByte has a signature of:

func (b *Reader) ReadBytes(delim byte) ([]byte, error)
Similar to ReadSlice, ReadBytes returns slices before and including the delimiter. In fact, ReadByte works over ReadSlice, which acts as the underlying low-level function. However, ReadByte can call multiple instances of ReadSlice to accumulate return data; therefore, circumventing buffer size limitations. Additionally, since ReadByte returns a new slice of byte, it is safer to use because consequent read operations will not overwrite the data.

#### 5. Scanner
Scanner breaks a stream of data by splitting it into tokens. Scanning stops at EOF, at first IO error, or if a token is too large to fit into the buffer. If more control over error handling is required, use bufio.Reader. Scanner has a signature of:

func NewScanner(r io.Reader) *Scanner
This is the split function used for dividing the text into token defaults to ScanLines; however, you change it if need be​.

```golang
package main
import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
  "strconv"
  "strings"
)

const singleLine string = "I'd love to have some coffee right about now"  
const multiLine string = "Reading is my...\r\n favourite"

func main() {
  
  fmt.Println("Lenght of singleLine input is " + strconv.Itoa(len(singleLine)))
  str := strings.NewReader(singleLine)
  br := bufio.NewReaderSize(str, 25) 
  
  fmt.Println("\n---Peek---")
  // Peek - Case 1: Simple peek implementation
  b, err := br.Peek(3)
  if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
  fmt.Printf("%q\n",b)  // output: "I'd"

  // Peek - Case 2: Peek larger than buffer size
  b, err = br.Peek(30)
  if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)  // output: "bufio: buffer full"
	}

  // Peek - Case 3: Buffer size larger than string
  br_large := bufio.NewReaderSize(str,50) 
  b, err = br_large.Peek(50)
  if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)  // output: EOF
	}

  // ReadSlice
  fmt.Println("\n---ReadSlice---")
  str = strings.NewReader(multiLine)
  r := bufio.NewReader(str)
  for {
    token, err := r.ReadSlice('.')
    if len(token) > 0 {
			fmt.Printf("Token (ReadSlice): %q\n", token)
		}
		if err != nil {
			break
		}
  }


  // ReadLine 
  fmt.Println("\n---ReadLine---")
  str = strings.NewReader(multiLine)
  r = bufio.NewReader(str)
  for {
    token, _ , err := r.ReadLine()
    if len(token) > 0 {
			fmt.Printf("Token (ReadLine): %q\n", token)
		}
		if err != nil {
			break
		}
  }

  // ReadBytes
  fmt.Println("\n---ReadBytes---")
  str = strings.NewReader(multiLine)
  r.Reset(str)
  for {
		token, err := r.ReadBytes('\n')
		fmt.Printf("Token (ReadBytes): %q\n", token)
		if err != nil {
			break
		}
	}
 

  // Scanner
  fmt.Println("\n---Scanner---")
  str = strings.NewReader(multiLine)
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(str)
	for scanner.Scan() {
		fmt.Printf("Token (Scanner): %q\n", scanner.Text())
	}



}
```

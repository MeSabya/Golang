## bufio.NewReader Vs bufio.NewScanner in golang

In Go, the bufio package provides buffered I/O operations. Both bufio.NewReader and bufio.NewScanner are used for reading input efficiently, but they have different use cases and characteristics.

### bufio.NewReader:

bufio.NewReader is used to wrap an existing io.Reader (such as a file, socket, or any other type that implements the io.Reader interface) and provide buffering for it.
It allows you to read data from the underlying io.Reader in chunks (buffers) rather than one byte at a time, which can improve performance.
It does not provide a mechanism for tokenizing input or splitting it into lines. It just gives you buffered access to the underlying reader.

Example:
```go
file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer file.Close()

reader := bufio.NewReader(file)
// Now you can use reader to efficiently read from the file in buffered chunks.
```
### bufio.NewScanner:

bufio.NewScanner is also used to wrap an io.Reader, but it provides a convenient way to tokenize input, typically splitting it into lines.
It automatically handles the process of reading lines and provides a convenient Scanner.Scan method for iterating over those lines.
It's particularly useful when dealing with text-based formats, like reading lines from a text file.
Example:

```go
file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer file.Close()

scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
for scanner.Scan() {
    // Each call to scanner.Scan() reads the next line from the file.
    line := scanner.Text()
    fmt.Println(line)
}

if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```
In summary, use bufio.NewReader when you need buffered access to an io.Reader without any specific line-based processing,
 and use bufio.NewScanner when you want to efficiently read lines from an io.Reader.

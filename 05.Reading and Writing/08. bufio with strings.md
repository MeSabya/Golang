```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	myString := "Hello, World!\nThis is a sample string."

	// Create a strings.Reader with your input string
	reader := strings.NewReader(myString)

	// Create a bufio.Reader
	bufReader := bufio.NewReader(reader)

	// Read and reverse lines in the string
	lineScanner := bufio.NewScanner(bufReader)
	for lineScanner.Scan() {
		line := lineScanner.Text()
		reversedLine := reverseString(line)
		fmt.Println(reversedLine)
	}
}

func reverseString(s string) string {
	runes := []rune(s)
	for i, j := 0, len(runes)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
		runes[i], runes[j] = runes[j], runes[i]
	}
	return string(runes)
}
```

### Why NewScanner is created from bufReader ...not from reader ?

The reason NewScanner is typically created from bufReader instead of reader directly is related to the benefits of buffering when working with scanners in Go.

bufio.Reader provides buffering, meaning it reads data from the underlying io.Reader in larger chunks and keeps some of it in memory. 
This can significantly improve the performance of reading operations by reducing the number of actual reads from the underlying source. 
When you create a bufio.Scanner from a bufio.Reader, it inherits these buffering benefits.

If you were to create the scanner directly from the original strings.Reader without the buffered reader, each call to Scanner.Scan() would likely 
result in more frequent and smaller reads from the underlying string, potentially making the process less efficient.

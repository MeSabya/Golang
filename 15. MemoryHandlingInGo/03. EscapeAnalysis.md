# What Is Escape Analysis in Go?

Escape analysis is a compiler optimization technique that determines whether a variable can be safely allocated on the stack, or if it "escapes" to the heap and must be managed by the garbage collector (GC).

To see escape behavior:

```bash
go run -gcflags="-m" main.go
```
## Example 1: Pointer returned from function (escapes)
```go
func newInt() *int {
    x := 42
    return &x
}
```
### 🔍 Why it escapes:
- x is a local variable, but you're returning its address.
- So, x must live beyond the function, and is allocated on the heap.


## ✅ Example 2: Pointer used only within function (does not escape)
```go
func localPointer() {
    x := 42
    p := &x
    fmt.Println(*p)
}
```
### 🔍 Why it does NOT escape:
p is never returned or stored globally.

Compiler proves it’s safe to allocate on the stack.

## ✅ Example 3: Struct passed by value vs by pointer

```go
type Data struct {
    x, y int
}

func valueParam(d Data) {
    fmt.Println(d.x + d.y)
}

func pointerParam(d *Data) {
    fmt.Println(d.x + d.y)
}
```
### 🔍 Escape depends on the caller:
```go
func main() {
    d := Data{1, 2}
    valueParam(d)   // no escape, copy of d passed
    pointerParam(&d) // d escapes because we take its address
}
```
d escapes to heap

## ✅ Example 4: Slice of pointers (heap) vs slice of values (stack)

```go
func makeSlicePtrs() []*int {
    a, b := 1, 2
    return []*int{&a, &b}
}
```
🔍 a and b escape: their addresses are returned.

```go
func makeSliceVals() []int {
    a, b := 1, 2
    return []int{a, b}
}
```
🔍 No escape here: values are copied.

## ✅ Example 5: Interface causes escape

```go
func useInterface(i interface{}) {
    fmt.Println(i)
}

func main() {
    x := 42
    useInterface(x)
}
```
🔍 x escapes:

When passed to interface{}, it must be boxed, and Go often allocates boxed values on the heap.

## ✅ Example 6: Channel + Goroutines may cause escape

```go
func main() {
    ch := make(chan *int)
    go func() {
        x := 42
        ch <- &x
    }()
    fmt.Println(<-ch)
}
```
🔍 x escapes:

It lives across a goroutine boundary. The Go runtime cannot prove when it will be read, so it goes to the heap.

## ✅ Example 7: Maps and escape

```go
func makeMap() {
    x := 100
    m := make(map[string]*int)
    m["a"] = &x
}
```
🔍 x escapes:

Its address is stored in a heap-allocated map, so it must outlive the function scope.

## ✅ Summary Table

- Returning address of local var	Yes	Must live beyond function
- Local pointer used internally only	No	Stays in stack frame
- Passing address to function	Yes	May be stored outside
- Interface conversion	Yes	Causes boxing on heap
- Goroutines and closures	Yes	Escapes stack frame to goroutine context
- Struct passed by value	No	Copy; no reference escaping
- Map with pointer value	Yes	Underlying map lives on heap

## How does passing a pointer to a function cause escape?
Passing a pointer can cause the underlying value to escape to the heap if the Go compiler can't guarantee the pointer won't be used after the calling function returns, or if it could be referenced elsewhere, such as:

- Stored in a global or heap object
- Captured in a closure
- Returned from the function
- Sent over a channel
- Used in a goroutine

### Example 1: Causes Escape

```go
type Data struct {
    value int
}

func store(d *Data) {
    global = d // stored in global scope
}

var global *Data

func main() {
    d := Data{value: 42}
    store(&d)
}
```
Here, d escapes because it's stored in global, which lives beyond the stack frame of main().

⛳ d must live on the heap, or it would be dangling after main() ends.

### ✅ Example 2: Escapes via Return

```go
func getPointer() *int {
    x := 10
    return &x // x escapes
}
```
Returning the address of a stack variable causes it to escape to the heap — otherwise, the pointer would be invalid.

### ✅ When Passing a Pointer Does Not Cause Escape
If:

The pointer is not returned, not stored, not captured, and

The compiler can prove it’s used only within the function call

Then it stays on the stack.

Example: No Escape

```go
func printValue(p *int) {
    fmt.Println(*p)
}

func main() {
    x := 5
    printValue(&x) // no escape
}
```
Here:

- x is passed to printValue
- It’s only read, not stored, not returned
- Compiler can keep x on the stack
Go’s escape analysis sees that it’s safe.

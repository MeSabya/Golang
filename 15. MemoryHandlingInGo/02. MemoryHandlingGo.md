## When is Memory block allocated in Golang?
In Go, memory allocation occurs primarily in two scenarios: when using new and make.

- new is used to allocate memory for single values (e.g., structs, primitive types) and returns a pointer to that value, which is zeroed.
- make is used to create slices, maps, and channels, and it initializes them with the appropriate structure and memory, so they are ready to use immediately.

## Where is Memory block allocated?

### Stack Allocation
Stack memory is used for local variables and function call information (like arguments and return addresses). It is managed automatically and has a very fast allocation and deallocation process.
Variables that are local to a function and have a known size at compile time are usually allocated on the stack.
Stack variables are automatically deallocated when the function they belong to returns.

Example of stack allocation:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    x := 10 // 'x' is allocated on the stack
    fmt.Println(x)
}
```
In this case, the integer x is allocated on the stack, and it is deallocated when the main function exits.

### Heap Allocation
Heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation. It's typically used when the size or lifetime of a variable is not known until runtime.
Heap memory is managed manually by Go's garbage collector (GC), which periodically frees unused memory.
new and make (for slices, maps, and channels) usually allocate memory on the heap if the object or data structure is long-lived or escapes the scope of the function.

Example of heap allocation:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

func main() {
    p := new(Person) // Allocated on the heap
    p.Name = "Alice"
    p.Age = 30
    fmt.Println(p)
}
```

In this example, the Person struct is allocated on the heap because new(Person) creates a pointer to a Person that is likely to outlive the function call and may be modified or accessed later. Go's garbage collector will free this memory when it's no longer referenced.

### Global/Static Memory
Global variables and constants are typically allocated in static memory. This memory is persistent throughout the program's execution and is not managed by the stack or heap.
Global variables are initialized at the start of the program, and their memory remains allocated until the program terminates.
Example of static/global memory allocation:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var globalVar int // Allocated in global/static memory

func main() {
    globalVar = 100
    fmt.Println(globalVar)
}
```

In this example, globalVar is stored in global/static memory and is initialized once during program startup.

Memory Allocation Summary:

- Stack: Fast, temporary memory used for local variables with known size at compile time. Memory is automatically cleaned up when the function scope ends.
- Heap: Dynamic memory used for objects whose lifetime and size are not determined at compile time. Managed by Go's garbage collector.
- Global/Static: Persistent memory used for global variables and constants that are accessible throughout the program's lifetime.

## Escape Analysis in Go

Escape analysis is the process used by the Go compiler to determine whether a variable can be allocated on the stack or if it must be allocated on the heap. This analysis helps Go decide where to store a variable's memory, and it directly influences memory management and performance.

***Stack Allocation:*** 
If the compiler determines that the variable will not outlive the function scope and is only used within the function, it can allocate it on the stack. This is faster and more efficient because the memory is automatically reclaimed when the function exits.

***Heap Allocation:*** 
If the variable "escapes" the function scope (i.e., it is referenced by something outside the function, such as being returned or assigned to a global variable), it must be allocated on the heap. The heap memory is managed by Go's garbage collector, but it has overhead compared to stack allocation.

### Example1: Heap Allocation (Escape Analysis)
In this example, the variable p escapes the function because it's returned from the function. As a result, the Go compiler allocates it on the heap.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func createPerson() *Person {
    p := Person{Name: "Bob", Age: 40}  // Local variable
    return &p                            // p escapes to the heap
}

type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

func main() {
    p := createPerson()  // p is now on the heap
    fmt.Println(p)
}
```

Explanation:
The Person struct p is allocated on the stack inside createPerson, but escapes when the pointer &p is returned to the caller.
Since p is returned as a pointer, the Go compiler knows that p may be used outside of the createPerson function, so it must be allocated on the heap.
The garbage collector will manage the memory for this heap-allocated object.

### Example 2: Escape Analysis with Goroutines
If a variable is passed to a goroutine, it escapes the function scope, and the Go compiler will allocate the memory on the heap.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func createPerson() *Person {
    p := Person{Name: "Charlie", Age: 50}  // Local variable
    go func() {
        fmt.Println(p)  // p escapes to the goroutine
    }()
    return &p
}

type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

func main() {
    p := createPerson()  // p is passed to a goroutine and must be heap-allocated
    fmt.Println(p)
}
```
Explanation:
The Person struct p is allocated on the stack initially, but it escapes to a goroutine when it is passed to the anonymous function running in a goroutine.
Since the goroutine could continue running even after the createPerson function exits, the Go compiler allocates p on the heap.

### Example 3: Escape Analysis with Closures
If a variable is captured by a closure, it escapes the function, and the Go compiler will allocate the memory on the heap.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func createPerson() func() {
    p := Person{Name: "Dave", Age: 60}  // Local variable
    return func() {
        fmt.Println(p)  // p escapes to the closure
    }
}

type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

func main() {
    closure := createPerson()  // p is captured by the closure and escapes
    closure()
}
```

### How to Check Escape Analysis
You can check how Go's escape analysis works using the -gcflags compiler flag to view escape analysis output:

```bash
go run -gcflags -m main.go
```
This will output escape analysis details, showing which variables are allocated on the stack or heap. For example:

```bash
./main.go:9:6: moved to heap: p
./main.go:13:6: p escapes to heap
```
This helps you understand which variables are moved to the heap due to escape analysis.

### Interfaces and Dynamic Dispatch
When variables are cast to an interface, Go may need to store the dynamic type of the variable on the heap. This happens because information about the variable's type needs to be stored alongside its value. For example:

```golang
func asInterface() interface{} {
    x := 42
    return x // Heap allocation because the variable is cast to interface{}
}
```
In this case, Go will allocate x on the heap to ensure the dynamic type information is available.

## Problem statement
Write a function that accepts two integers and returns their sum, product and difference (in the same order). Make a version with named return variables.

Sum, product, and difference between two numbers

### Sample input
3, 4

### Sample output
7,12,-1 // 3+4=7, 3*4=12, and 3-4=-1

```go
package main
import (
    "fmt"
)

func SumProductDiff(i, j int)(s int, p int, d int) {
    s, p, d = i + j, i * j, i - j
    return
}

func main() {
        sum, prod, diff := SumProductDiff(3, 4)
        fmt.Println("Sum:", sum, "| Product:", prod, "| Diff:", diff)
}
```

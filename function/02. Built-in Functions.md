## new and make
Both new and make are used for allocating memory. The function new is used for value types and user-defined types like structs. Whereas, make is used for built-in reference types (slices, maps, channels). They are used like functions with the type as its argument:

```golang
new(type) 
make(type)
```

new(T) allocates zeroed storage for a new item of type T and returns its address. 
It returns a pointer to the type T (details are in Chapter 8), and it can be used with primitive types as well:

v := new(int) // v has type *int

The function make(T) returns an initialized variable of type T, so it does more work than new.

Remark: new() is a function; donâ€™t forget its parentheses.

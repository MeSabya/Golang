## Receiver parameter in Go 

In Go, a receiver parameter is a special parameter in a method declaration that allows a type to define methods that can be called on its instances.

```golang
func (r ReceiverType) MethodName(arguments) { 
 // method implementation 
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ The ReceiverType is the type on which the method is defined, and it can be either a value or a pointer type. The MethodName is the name of the method, and it can be any valid identifier.

ðŸ‘‰ When a method is called on a value of the ReceiverType, Go automatically passes a copy of the value as the receiver parameter to the method. If the receiver parameter is a pointer type, Go passes a copy of the pointer, which points to the original value.

ðŸ‘‰ *** Very Important ***

### Calling methods on values and pointers
There can be methods attached to the type, and other methods attach a pointer to the type. However, this does not matter: if for a type T a method Meth() exists on *T and t is a variable of type T, then t.Meth() is automatically translated to (&t).Meth(). Pointer and value methods can both be called on the pointer or non-pointer values. This is illustrated in the following program:

```golang
package main
import (
"fmt"
)

type List []int

func (l List) Len() int { return len(l) }

func (l *List) Append(val int) { *l = append(*l, val) }

func main() {
  // A bare value
  var lst List
  lst.Append(1)
  fmt.Printf("%v (len: %d)\n", lst, lst.Len()) // [1] (len: 1)
  
  lst.Append(2)
  fmt.Printf("%v (len: %d)\n", lst, lst.Len()) // &[2] (len: 1)

  // A pointer value
  plst := new(List)
  plst.Append(2)
  fmt.Printf("%v (len: %d)\n", plst, plst.Len())

}
```

ðŸ‘‰ The output of the above is 

```
[1] (len: 1)
[1 2] (len: 2)
&[2] (len: 1)
```

ðŸ‘‰ Summary is:
Methods on variables do not distinguish between values or pointers.
They converted automatically.

Sometimes, we do not want to give a function a name. Instead, we can make an anonymous function (also known as a lambda function, a function literal, or a closure), for example:

```golang
func(x, y int) int { return x + y }
```

Such a function cannot stand on its own (the compiler gives the error: non-declaration statement outside function body), but it can be assigned to a variable which is a reference to that function:

```golang
fplus := func(x, y int) int { return x + y }
```

Then it can be invoked as if fplus was the name of the function:

fplus(3,4)
or it can be invoked directly:

```golang
func(x, y int) int { return x + y } (3, 4)
```

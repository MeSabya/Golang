Sometimes, we do not want to give a function a name. Instead, we can make an anonymous function (also known as a lambda function, a function literal, or a closure), for example:

```golang
func(x, y int) int { return x + y }
```

Such a function cannot stand on its own (the compiler gives the error: non-declaration statement outside function body), but it can be assigned to a variable which is a reference to that function:

```golang
fplus := func(x, y int) int { return x + y }
```

Then it can be invoked as if fplus was the name of the function:

fplus(3,4)
or it can be invoked directly:

```golang
func(x, y int) int { return x + y } (3, 4)
```

## Quizzes on closure
### Question1:
```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var funcs []func()

    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        funcs = append(funcs, func() {
            fmt.Println(i)
        })
    }

    for _, f := range funcs {
        f()
    }
}
```
Explanation: The program will print three instances of the value 3. The reason is that the closure captures the variable i, 
and at the time the closures are executed in the second loop, the loop variable i is equal to 3. The closure refers to the same variable i, not the value it had when the closure was created.

### Question2:
```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    functions := make([]func(), 3)

    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        val := i
        functions[i] = func() {
            fmt.Println(val)
        }
    }

    for _, f := range functions {
        f()
    }
}
```
Explanation: This program prints 0, 1, and 2. Unlike the previous example, here, we create a new variable val inside the loop and capture that in the closure. Each closure captures a different val, so when executed, they print the values 0, 1, and 2 respectively.

### Example 3: Memoization

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fib := memoize(fibonacci)

    fmt.Println(fib(5)) // 5
    fmt.Println(fib(8)) // 21
}

func memoize(f func(int) int) func(int) int {
    cache := make(map[int]int)
    return func(n int) int {
        if val, ok := cache[n]; ok {
            return val
        }
        result := f(n)
        cache[n] = result
        return result
    }
}

func fibonacci(n int) int {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n
    }
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
}
```
This example shows a closure used for memoization. The memoize function takes a function f and returns a closure that caches the results of f for each input.

These examples showcase different use cases for closures in Go, including creating stateful functions, function generators, and memoization. Closures are a powerful feature in Go that allows you to capture and use variables from the enclosing scope.

## Understanding the slice 
ðŸ‘‰ A slice is a reference data type. Inside there is a pointer to the first element of the slice. This factor is what determines how certain operations, even when performed on copies of the slice, can affect the original slice.

ðŸ‘‰ A slice has a length, which describes the number of elements currently stored in the slice, and a capacity, which indicates how many elements can be added to this memory area.

ðŸ‘‰ **If the inequality len(x) + 1 <= cap(x) is not met when adding a new element, the slice expands into a new area of memory, and capacity doubles (until it reaches the size of 1024, after which they increase by 25% with each expansion).**

A slice is a reference type that includes three main components:

- Pointer to the array. This pointer points to the first element of the slice in the underlying array (the â€˜sliceâ€™ type in Go is an abstraction built over the array type).
- Length. This is the number of stored elements in the slice. The length determines the current size of the slice, and it can be obtained using the len(slice) function.

- Capacity. The capacity of a slice determines how many elements it can contain without the need to expand the underlying array. The capacity can be equal to or larger than the length of the slice, and it can be obtained using the cap(slice) function.

### Example1:

```golang
func main() {
  var x []int      // x=[], len=0, cap=0
  x = append(x, 1) // x=[1], len=1, cap=1
  x = append(x, 2) // x=[1, 2], len=2, cap=2
  x = append(x, 3) // x=[1, 2, 3], len=3, cap=4
  y := x           // y=[1, 2, 3], len=3, cap=4
  x = append(x, 4) // x=[1, 2, 3, 4], len=4, cap=4
  y = append(y, 5) // x=[1, 2, 3, 5], len=4, cap=4
  x[0] = 0         // x=[0, 2, 3, 5], len=4, cap=4

  fmt.Println(x)   // x=[0, 2, 3, 5], len=4, cap=4
  fmt.Println(y)   // y=[0, 2, 3, 5], len=4, cap=4
}
```

### Example 2: Slice expansion

```golang
func main() {
  x := []int{1,2,3,4}
  y := x
  x = append(x, 5)
  y = append(y, 6)
  x[0] = 0
  fmt.Println(x)
  fmt.Println(y)
}
```

What will fmt.Println(x) and fmt.Println(y) output here?

Here is the answer right away: [0,2,3,4,5] for x and [1,2,3,4,6] for y.

Why in this case x[0] = 0 replaced the first element only in the slice x, but not in y? And the last element is also different for x and y?

The fact is that at the moment of adding a new element to x and y, the slice had a length of 4 and a capacity of 4.

During the x = append(x, 5) the slice expanded into a new area of memory, where the capacity now became equal to 8.

Now x and y stopped referring to the same first element of the slice, and ended up in different areas of memory. Similarly, for this reason adding the value 6 to the slice y did not affect the x slice at all.

For convenience, the step-by-step change of len and cap in the code:

```golang
func main() {
  x := []int{1,2,3,4} // x=[1,2,3,4], len=4, cap=4
  y := x              // y=[1,2,3,4], len=4, cap=4
  x = append(x, 5)    // x=[1,2,3,4,5], len=5, cap=8
  y = append(y, 6)    // y=[1,2,3,4,6], len=5, cap=8
  x[0] = 0            // x=[0,2,3,4,5], len=5, cap=8

  fmt.Println(x)      // x=[0,2,3,4,5], len=5, cap=8
  fmt.Println(y)      // y=[1,2,3,4,6], len=5, cap=8
}
```

### Example 3. Subslices
```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  x := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  x = append(x, 6)
  x = append(x, 7)
  a := x[4:]
  y := alterSlice(a)
  fmt.Println(x)
  fmt.Println(y)
}

func alterSlice(a []int) []int {
  a[0] = 10
  a = append(a, 11)
  return a
}
```

ðŸ‘‰ **hat will fmt.Println(x) and fmt.Println(y) print?**

Letâ€™s go step by step through our code. When creating x we initialize the slice with initial values. 
At this point, the slice will be preallocated and the length and capacity of the slice will be equal to 5:

x := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} // x = [1,2,3,4,5], len=5, cap=5
Next, when we add a new element to the slice, which has len = cap, slice expansion will occur, the capacity will double to 10:

x = append(x, 6) // x = [1,2,3,4,5,6], len=6, cap=10
x = append(x, 7) // x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], len=7, cap=10

Next, we create a slice from the 4th element to the end of our slice.

a := x[4:]
The length of the slice in our case will be equal to the length of the original slice minus the first index of the slice: len(a) = 7 â€” 4 = 3.

Meanwhile, the capacity of the slice is calculated as the capacity of the original slice minus the first index of the slice: cap(a) = 10 â€” 4 = 6.

Thus, we get a slice: a = [5,6,7], len=3, cap=6.

The function alterSlice changes the 0 index of our slice a, which points to the 4th index of the slice x.

Then, the value 11 is added to a, and since the inequality len(a) + 1 < cap(a) holds true there will be no relocation of data. And as a result, we get:

[1,2,3,4,10,6,7] for x and [10, 6, 7, 11] for y.

Code with step-by-step change:

```golang
import "fmt"
func main() {
  x := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} // [1,2,3,4,5], len=5, cap=5
  x = append(x, 6)          // [1,2,3,4,5,6], len=6, cap=10
  x = append(x, 7)          // [1,2,3,4,5,6, 7], len=7, cap=10
  a := x[4:]                // [5,6,7], len=3, cap=6
  y := alterSlice(a)        // [10, 6, 7, 11], len=4, cap=6

  fmt.Println(x)            // [1,2,3,4,10,6,7], len=7, cap=10
  fmt.Println(y)            // [10, 6, 7, 11]
}
func alterSlice(a []int) []int {
  a[0] = 10                 // [10, 6, 7], len=3, cap=6
  a = append(a, 11)         // [10, 6, 7, 11], len=4, cap=6
  return a
}
```

## Understanding the append Function 

```golang
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    arr := []int{1, 2, 3}
    fmt.Println("Len of arr", len(arr))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr", cap(arr))
    
    arr1 := arr[:1]
    fmt.Println("arr and arr1", arr, arr1)
    fmt.Println("Len of arr1", len(arr1))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr1", cap(arr1))
    
    arr1 = append(arr1, 5)
    fmt.Println("arr and arr1", arr, arr1)
    fmt.Println("Len of arr1", len(arr1))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr1", cap(arr1))
       
    arr1 = append(arr1, 6)
    fmt.Println("arr and arr1", arr, arr1)
    fmt.Println("Len of arr1", len(arr1))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr1", cap(arr1))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr", cap(arr))
    
    arr1 = append(arr1, 7)
    fmt.Println("arr and arr1", arr, arr1)
    fmt.Println("Len of arr1", len(arr1))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr1", cap(arr1))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr", cap(arr))
}
```

```bash
Len of arr 3
Cap of arr 3
arr and arr1 [1 2 3] [1]
Len of arr1 1
Cap of arr1 3
arr and arr1 [1 5 3] [1 5]
Len of arr1 2
Cap of arr1 3
arr and arr1 [1 5 6] [1 5 6]
Len of arr1 3
Cap of arr1 3
Cap of arr 3
arr and arr1 [1 5 6] [1 5 6 7]
Len of arr1 4
Cap of arr1 6
Cap of arr 3
```

### Explanation
Initial Slice:

arr is a slice with elements {1, 2, 3}.
The length of arr is 3, and the capacity is also 3.
Slice arr1 Created:

arr1 := arr[:1] creates a new slice arr1 that includes the first element of arr (resulting in {1}).
The length of arr1 is 1, and the capacity is still 3.
Append Element to arr1:

arr1 = append(arr1, 5) appends 5 to arr1.
The length of arr1 becomes 2, and the capacity remains 3.
Now, arr1 contains {1, 5}.
Append Another Element to arr1:

arr1 = append(arr1, 6) appends 6 to arr1.
The length of arr1 becomes 3, and the capacity remains 3.
Now, arr1 contains {1, 5, 6}.
Append Yet Another Element to arr1:

arr1 = append(arr1, 7) appends 7 to arr1.
Since the capacity of arr1 is not sufficient, Go automatically increases the capacity by allocating a new underlying array, copying the existing elements, and appending the new element.
The length of arr1 becomes 4, and the new capacity becomes 6 (as Go often doubles the capacity).
Now, arr1 contains {1, 5, 6, 7}.

Print the Final Output:

The last set of Println statements shows the state of both arr and arr1.
**The capacity of arr remains 3 throughout these operations, and the capacity of arr1 increases dynamically as needed.**
In summary, when appending elements to a slice, Go dynamically manages the capacity by reallocating the underlying array as necessary. The growth factor is often implementation-dependent, but it's common for Go to double the capacity to achieve amortized constant-time complexity for append operations.

## Understand the last point on capacity and new array allocation

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    slice := []int{1, 2, 3}
    fmt.Println("Original Slice:", slice)
    fmt.Println("Original Capacity:", cap(slice))

    // Append elements that exceed the capacity
    slice1 := append(slice, 4, 5, 6, 7)

    fmt.Println("Original Slice:", slice)
    fmt.Println("Original Capacity:", cap(slice))
    fmt.Println("Updated Slice:", slice1)
    fmt.Println("Updated Capacity:", cap(slice1))
}
```
## What could be the possible implementation of append function.
```golang
func Append(items []int, i int) []int {
	if len(items) == cap(items) { // No more space in underlying array
		// Go has a better growth heuristic than adding 1 every append
		newItems := make([]int, len(items)+1)
		copy(newItems, items)
		items = newItems
	} else {
		items = items[:len(items)+1]
	}

	items[len(items)-1] = i
	return items
}
```
### Explanation
The function first checks if the length of the slice (len(items)) is equal to the capacity of the slice (cap(items)). If they are equal, it means there is no more space in the underlying array.

If there's no more space, it creates a new slice (newItems) with a length increased by 1. This ensures that there is room for the new element.

It then copies the existing elements from the original slice (items) to the new slice (newItems) using the copy function.

The reference items is updated to point to the new slice, effectively replacing the original slice.

If there is enough capacity, it simply extends the slice by one element using slicing (items[:len(items)+1]).

Finally, it adds the new element at the end of the slice and returns the modified slice.

This function ensures that the slice has enough capacity to accommodate the new element efficiently, and it takes advantage of Go's built-in append behavior by handling the capacity growth in a way that is generally more efficient than adding one element at a time.

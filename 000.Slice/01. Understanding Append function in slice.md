## Understanding the append Function 

```golang
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    arr := []int{1, 2, 3}
    fmt.Println("Len of arr", len(arr))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr", cap(arr))
    
    arr1 := arr[:1]
    fmt.Println("arr and arr1", arr, arr1)
    fmt.Println("Len of arr1", len(arr1))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr1", cap(arr1))
    
    arr1 = append(arr1, 5)
    fmt.Println("arr and arr1", arr, arr1)
    fmt.Println("Len of arr1", len(arr1))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr1", cap(arr1))
       
    arr1 = append(arr1, 6)
    fmt.Println("arr and arr1", arr, arr1)
    fmt.Println("Len of arr1", len(arr1))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr1", cap(arr1))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr", cap(arr))
    
    arr1 = append(arr1, 7)
    fmt.Println("arr and arr1", arr, arr1)
    fmt.Println("Len of arr1", len(arr1))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr1", cap(arr1))
    fmt.Println("Cap of arr", cap(arr))
}
```

```bash
Len of arr 3
Cap of arr 3
arr and arr1 [1 2 3] [1]
Len of arr1 1
Cap of arr1 3
arr and arr1 [1 5 3] [1 5]
Len of arr1 2
Cap of arr1 3
arr and arr1 [1 5 6] [1 5 6]
Len of arr1 3
Cap of arr1 3
Cap of arr 3
arr and arr1 [1 5 6] [1 5 6 7]
Len of arr1 4
Cap of arr1 6
Cap of arr 3
```

### Explanation
Initial Slice:

arr is a slice with elements {1, 2, 3}.
The length of arr is 3, and the capacity is also 3.
Slice arr1 Created:

arr1 := arr[:1] creates a new slice arr1 that includes the first element of arr (resulting in {1}).
The length of arr1 is 1, and the capacity is still 3.
Append Element to arr1:

arr1 = append(arr1, 5) appends 5 to arr1.
The length of arr1 becomes 2, and the capacity remains 3.
Now, arr1 contains {1, 5}.
Append Another Element to arr1:

arr1 = append(arr1, 6) appends 6 to arr1.
The length of arr1 becomes 3, and the capacity remains 3.
Now, arr1 contains {1, 5, 6}.
Append Yet Another Element to arr1:

arr1 = append(arr1, 7) appends 7 to arr1.
Since the capacity of arr1 is not sufficient, Go automatically increases the capacity by allocating a new underlying array, copying the existing elements, and appending the new element.
The length of arr1 becomes 4, and the new capacity becomes 6 (as Go often doubles the capacity).
Now, arr1 contains {1, 5, 6, 7}.

Print the Final Output:

The last set of Println statements shows the state of both arr and arr1.
**The capacity of arr remains 3 throughout these operations, and the capacity of arr1 increases dynamically as needed.**
In summary, when appending elements to a slice, Go dynamically manages the capacity by reallocating the underlying array as necessary. The growth factor is often implementation-dependent, but it's common for Go to double the capacity to achieve amortized constant-time complexity for append operations.

## Understand the last point on capacity and new array allocation

```golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    slice := []int{1, 2, 3}
    fmt.Println("Original Slice:", slice)
    fmt.Println("Original Capacity:", cap(slice))

    // Append elements that exceed the capacity
    slice1 := append(slice, 4, 5, 6, 7)

    fmt.Println("Original Slice:", slice)
    fmt.Println("Original Capacity:", cap(slice))
    fmt.Println("Updated Slice:", slice1)
    fmt.Println("Updated Capacity:", cap(slice1))
}
```
## What could be the possible implementation of append function.
```golang
func Append(items []int, i int) []int {
	if len(items) == cap(items) { // No more space in underlying array
		// Go has a better growth heuristic than adding 1 every append
		newItems := make([]int, len(items)+1)
		copy(newItems, items)
		items = newItems
	} else {
		items = items[:len(items)+1]
	}

	items[len(items)-1] = i
	return items
}
```
### Explanation
The function first checks if the length of the slice (len(items)) is equal to the capacity of the slice (cap(items)). If they are equal, it means there is no more space in the underlying array.

If there's no more space, it creates a new slice (newItems) with a length increased by 1. This ensures that there is room for the new element.

It then copies the existing elements from the original slice (items) to the new slice (newItems) using the copy function.

The reference items is updated to point to the new slice, effectively replacing the original slice.

If there is enough capacity, it simply extends the slice by one element using slicing (items[:len(items)+1]).

Finally, it adds the new element at the end of the slice and returns the modified slice.

This function ensures that the slice has enough capacity to accommodate the new element efficiently, and it takes advantage of Go's built-in append behavior by handling the capacity growth in a way that is generally more efficient than adding one element at a time.

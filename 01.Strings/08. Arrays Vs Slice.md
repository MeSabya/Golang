A slice points to the underlying array. This array could potentially be much bigger than the slice. As long as the slice is referred to, the full array will be kept in memory until it is no longer referenced.

ðŸ‘‰ One big difference between a Go array and a Go slice is that you have to say the size of an array upfront when you declare it. For example, you would declare an array of two strings with the type [2]string instead of []string:

```golang
// A slice of strings, with two items in it
vehiclesSlice := []string{"car", "PokÃ©mon that knows SURF"}
// An array with two items in it, with its size set to two
vehiclesArray := [2]string{"car", "PokÃ©mon that knows SURF"}
```

when you append to a slice with a line of code like 
```
vehiclesSlice = append(vehiclesSlice, "Catbus"), 
```
what actually happens is:

1. The slice increments its length, so len(vehicles) is now 3.
   
2. If there is still space left in the underlying array, our slice isn't at maximum capacity, so the item is just added to a new slot in the array.

3. But if the underlying array was already full because arrays are fixed-size, that means we need to allocate a new, bigger array in memory and then copy everything over to it.

## Applying Strings, Arrays and Slices

### Making a slice of bytes or runes from a string

If s is a string (so also an array of bytes), a slice of bytes c can immediately be made with

```
c:=[]byte(s)
```

**Or**

This can also be done with the copy-function:

```
copy(dst []byte, src string)
```

**Or**
```
var b []byte
var s string
b = append(b, s...)
```

In Go, the recommended location for your Go source code is within the Go workspace. The Go workspace typically has the following directory structure:

```lua
GOPATH/
|-- bin/
|-- pkg/
|-- src/
    |-- github.com/
        |-- yourusername/
            |-- yourproject/
                |-- main.go
```
Here:

- GOPATH is an environment variable that points to the root of your workspace.
- bin/ contains the executable binaries.
- pkg/ contains package objects.
- src/ contains your source code.

Each project you work on should have its own folder under src/. In the example above, yourusername represents your GitHub username, and yourproject is the name of your Go project.

However, starting from Go 1.11, you have the option to work outside the traditional workspace by using Go modules. With Go modules, you can place your code in any directory, and Go will manage dependencies for you.

Here is an example of a project structure using Go modules:

```lua
myproject/
|-- go.mod
|-- go.sum
|-- main.go
|-- greetings/
    |-- greetings.go
```

In this structure:

- go.mod and go.sum are files created and managed by Go modules.
- main.go is your main program.
- greetings/ is a package that you might create.

To create a Go module, you can run the following command inside your project directory:

```bash
go mod init myproject
```

This will initialize a Go module for your project.

Remember, Go is flexible, and you have the freedom to organize your code the way that makes sense for your project. The Go module approach provides more flexibility in terms of project organization and dependency management.
